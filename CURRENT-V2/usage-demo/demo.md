# Demonstration of the Full BMad Workflow Agent Gem Usage

## BA Brainstorming

The following link shows the full chat thread with the BA demonstrating many features of this amazing agent. I started out not even knowing what to build, and it helped me ideate with the goal of something interesting for tutorial purposes, refine it, do some deep research (in thinking mode, i did not switch models), gave some great alternative details and ideas, prompted me section by section eventually to produce the brief. It worked amazingly well. You can read the full transcript and output here:

## PM Brainstorming (Oops it was not the PM LOL)

I took the final output md brief with prompt for the PM at the end of the last chat and created a google doc to make it easier to share with the pm (I could have probably just pasted it into the new chat, but its easier if i want to start over). In google docs its so easy to just create a new doc, right click and select 'Paste from MArkdown', then click in the title and it will automatically name and save it with the title of the document. I then started a chat with the 2-PM Gem, also in gemini 2.5 pro thinking mode by attaching the google doc and telling it to reference the prompt. This is the transcript. I realized that I accidentally had pasted the BA prompt also into the PM prompt, so this actually ended up producing a pretty nicely refined brief 2.0 instead LOL

So I tool that output file and put it into the actual BA again to produce a new version with prompt as seen in [this file](final-brief-with-pm-prompt.txt).

## PM Brainstorming Take 2

I will going forward with the rest of the process not use google docs even though its preferred and instead attach txt attachments of previous phase documents, this is required or else the link will be un-sharable.

Of note here is how I am not passive in this process and you should not be either - I looked at its proposed epics in its first prd draft after answering the initial questions and spotting something really dumb, it had a final epic for doing file output and logging all the way at the end - when really this should be happening incrementally with each epic. The Architect or PO I hope would have caught this later and the PM might also if i let it get to the checklist phase, but if you can work with it you will have quicker results and better off.

Also notice, since we came to the PM with the amazing brief + prompt embedded in it - it only had like 1 question before producing the first draft - amazing!!!

The PM did a great job of asking the right questions, and producing the [Draft PRD](./draft-prd.txt), and each epic, [1](./epic1-draft.txt), [2](./epic2-draft.txt), [3](./epic3-draft.txt), [4](./epic4-draft.txt), [5](epic5-draft.txt)
