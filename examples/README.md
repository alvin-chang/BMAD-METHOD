# BMADâ„¢ Orchestrator Comprehensive Demo

This directory contains a comprehensive example script that demonstrates all the key features of the BMAD Orchestrator in a realistic software development scenario.

## Overview

The `comprehensive-orchestrator-demo.js` script showcases how the BMAD Orchestrator can coordinate multiple specialized AI agents to deliver complex software projects. The example follows a complete project lifecycle from initial planning through implementation and deployment.

## Features Demonstrated

- **Agent Coordination**: Task delegation to specialized agents
- **Workflow Management**: Creation, modification, monitoring, and cloning of workflows
- **Resource Allocation**: Resource management and optimization
- **Performance Monitoring**: Health checks, bottleneck detection, and risk assessment
- **Conflict Resolution**: Mediation between agents with conflicting recommendations
- **Escalation Handling**: Critical issue escalation to appropriate stakeholders
- **Reporting and Analytics**: Status reports and performance metrics
- **Advanced Features**: Enhanced orchestrator capabilities (visualization, delivery prediction)

## Running the Demo

To run the comprehensive orchestrator demo:

```bash
node examples/comprehensive-orchestrator-demo.js
```

The script will simulate a complete software development project and demonstrate how the orchestrator coordinates between different specialized agents.

## CLI Usage

You can also interact with the orchestrator directly through its CLI:

```bash
# Show all available commands
npm run orchestrator:cli help

# Display current status
npm run orchestrator:cli status

# List all agents
npm run orchestrator:cli agents

# List all workflows
npm run orchestrator:cli workflows
```

## Key Concepts Demonstrated

### 1. Multi-Agent Coordination
The orchestrator serves as the central hub for coordinating between specialized agents:
- **Developer Agents**: Implement code and features
- **QA Agents**: Ensure quality through testing
- **UX Experts**: Design user interfaces and experiences
- **Architects**: Design system architecture and technical solutions
- **Project Managers**: Oversee project timeline and deliverables

### 2. Workflow Management
Workflows represent complete processes that span multiple agents and phases:
- Creation of structured, multi-phase workflows
- Real-time monitoring of workflow progress
- Cloning of existing workflows for similar features
- Pausing and resuming workflows as needed

### 3. Resource Optimization
The orchestrator manages computing and human resources:
- Allocation of resources to specific workflows
- Optimization of resource utilization
- Capacity planning for future workloads

### 4. Performance Monitoring
Continuous monitoring ensures project health:
- Bottleneck detection and resolution
- Risk assessment for potential delays
- Performance analytics and reporting

### 5. Conflict Resolution
When agents have conflicting recommendations, the orchestrator mediates:
- Facilitated discussions between agents
- Consensus building for technical decisions
- Escalation paths for unresolved conflicts

## Real-World Application

In a production environment, the orchestrator would:
1. Coordinate actual AI agents registered with the system
2. Manage real computing resources and infrastructure
3. Track actual project progress and timelines
4. Interface with real stakeholder communication channels
5. Store and retrieve context from persistent memory
