## Technical Architecture

The Enhanced Orchestrator follows a modular architecture with five core components:

1. **WorkflowManager** - Manages workflow lifecycles with creation, modification, and visualization capabilities
2. **AgentCoordinator** - Coordinates agent interactions with workload balancing and conflict resolution
3. **PerformanceMonitor** - Monitors system performance with bottleneck detection and delivery prediction
4. **ResourceManager** - Manages resource allocation with optimization and capacity planning
5. **EscalationManager** - Handles issue escalations and conflict resolution between agents

## Memory System Integration

All orchestrator activities are automatically stored in the memory system with appropriate prefixes:

- `ORCH:WORKFLOW:` - Workflow-related activities
- `ORCH:AGENT:` - Agent coordination activities
- `ORCH:RESOURCE:` - Resource management activities
- `ORCH:ESCALATION:` - Escalation and conflict resolution activities
- `ORCH:VISUALIZATION:` - Workflow visualization activities
- `ORCH:ANALYTICS:` - Performance analytics activities
- `ORCH:PREDICTION:` - Delivery prediction activities
