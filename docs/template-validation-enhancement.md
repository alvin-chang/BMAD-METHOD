# Template Validation Enhancement for BMAD Method

## Overview

This document outlines the proposed enhancement to the BMAD method's template system to include comprehensive validation and error handling. The goal is to improve the reliability and user experience of template-based document generation while maintaining backward compatibility.

## Current State Analysis

The current template system uses YAML-based templates with a defined structure but lacks comprehensive validation. Users may encounter issues such as:

1. Invalid YAML syntax
2. Missing required fields
3. Incorrect field types
4. Undefined section references
5. Circular dependencies in repeatable sections

## Proposed Enhancement

### 1. Schema Validation

Implement a comprehensive JSON Schema validation for all template files:

```yaml
# Template schema validation
template:
  type: object
  required: [id, name, version, output, workflow, sections]
  properties:
    id:
      type: string
      pattern: "^[a-z0-9-]+$"
    name:
      type: string
      minLength: 1
    version:
      type: string
      pattern: "^\d+\.\d+$"
    output:
      type: object
      required: [format, filename, title]
    workflow:
      type: object
      required: [mode, elicitation]
    sections:
      type: array
      items:
        $ref: "#/definitions/section"
  
definitions:
  section:
    type: object
    required: [id, title, instruction]
    properties:
      id:
        type: string
        pattern: "^[a-z0-9-]+$"
      title:
        type: string
        minLength: 1
      instruction:
        type: string
        minLength: 1
      # ... other properties
```

### 2. Real-time Validation Feedback

Implement real-time validation that provides immediate feedback to users:

1. Syntax highlighting for YAML files with error indicators
2. Inline error messages with detailed explanations
3. Suggestions for fixing common errors
4. Validation status indicators in the UI

### 3. Graceful Error Recovery

Implement mechanisms to handle template errors gracefully:

1. Partial template processing when non-critical sections have errors
2. Fallback values for missing optional fields
3. Clear error reporting that distinguishes between critical and non-critical issues
4. Recovery suggestions for common error patterns

### 4. Template Linting

Add linting capabilities to identify potential issues:

1. Unused variables
2. Inconsistent naming conventions
3. Deprecated fields or patterns
4. Performance anti-patterns (e.g., deeply nested repeatable sections)

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Validation Engine (2 weeks)

1. Develop JSON Schema definitions for all template components
2. Implement validation engine that can validate templates against schemas
3. Create validation report format with error codes and descriptions
4. Integrate validation into the template processing pipeline

### Phase 2: User Interface Integration (3 weeks)

1. Add validation status indicators to template editing UI
2. Implement real-time validation as users edit templates
3. Create detailed error reporting interface
4. Add quick-fix suggestions for common errors

### Phase 3: Graceful Error Handling (2 weeks)

1. Implement partial template processing capabilities
2. Add fallback mechanisms for missing optional fields
3. Create recovery suggestions for common error patterns
4. Implement validation exception handling

### Phase 4: Template Linting (2 weeks)

1. Develop linting rules for template best practices
2. Implement linting engine that can analyze templates
3. Add linting reports to validation output
4. Create quick-fix suggestions for linting issues

## Backward Compatibility

All enhancements will maintain backward compatibility with existing templates:

1. Existing templates will continue to work without modification
2. New validation features will be optional for existing projects
3. Deprecation warnings will be provided for outdated patterns
4. Migration tools will be provided for template upgrades

## Testing Strategy

1. Unit tests for validation engine components
2. Integration tests for template processing with validation
3. User acceptance tests for validation UI features
4. Performance tests to ensure validation doesn't significantly impact processing speed

## Success Metrics

1. Reduction in template-related errors reported by users
2. Improvement in template creation time for new users
3. Increase in successful template processing rates
4. Positive feedback on validation features in user surveys

## Dependencies

1. YAML parsing library (existing dependency)
2. JSON Schema validation library (new dependency)
3. UI components for validation feedback (existing components with modifications)

## Risks and Mitigation

1. **Performance Impact**: Mitigate by implementing asynchronous validation
2. **False Positives**: Mitigate by providing override mechanisms and clear error descriptions
3. **User Confusion**: Mitigate by providing clear documentation and tutorials
4. **Complexity Overload**: Mitigate by making validation features optional and configurable
