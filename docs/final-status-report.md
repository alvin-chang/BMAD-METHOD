## Usage Instructions

### Template Validation

```bash
# Validate a template
npm run validate:templates my-template.yaml

# Lint a template for best practices
npm run lint:templates my-template.yaml

# Watch a template for changes with real-time validation
npm run validate:templates:watch my-template.yaml
```

### CLI Tools

```bash
# Validate templates using CLI tools
npx template-validator my-template.yaml
npx template-linter my-template.yaml
npx template-validator-watch my-template.yaml
```

### Enhanced Orchestrator

In an AI-enabled IDE, load the enhanced orchestrator agent:

```
@.bmad-core/agents/enhanced-bmad-orchestrator.md
```

The enhanced orchestrator provides:

- Workflow visualization with Mermaid diagrams
- Real-time monitoring and alerting
- Bottleneck detection and resolution
- Resource optimization
- Conflict mediation
