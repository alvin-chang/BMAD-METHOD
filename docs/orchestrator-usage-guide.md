## Performance Monitoring

### Monitor

Monitor performance across agents or workflows:

```
*monitor health cpu,memory,disk
```

### Optimize

Optimize resource allocation or workflow efficiency:

```
*optimize resources {"maxUtilization": 80}
```

### Report

Generate orchestration reports for stakeholders:

```
*report performance management,team monthly
```

## Escalation Management

### Escalate

Escalate critical issues to appropriate stakeholders:

```
*escalate "Production server down" "Server is not responding to requests" "critical"
```

## Practical Examples

### Managing a Software Development Project

1. Create a workflow for the project:
   ```
   *create-workflow "E-commerce Platform" analyst,architect,developer,tester,devops requirements,design,implementation,testing,deployment
   ```

2. Register agents:
   ```
   *agents
   ```

3. Assign initial tasks:
   ```
   *delegate "Gather requirements for product catalog" analyst "E-commerce platform requirements"
   ```

4. Monitor progress:
   ```
   *status
   ```

5. Handle issues:
   ```
   *escalate "Database performance issues" "Slow query performance affecting user experience" "high"
   ```

### Resource Management

1. Register resources:
   ```
   *resources
   ```

2. Allocate resources to workflows:
   ```
   *resources
   ```

3. Optimize resource allocation:
   ```
   *optimize resources {"strategy": "load-balanced"}
   ```

### Performance Monitoring

1. Monitor system health:
   ```
   *monitor health cpu,memory,network
   ```

2. Detect bottlenecks:
   ```
   *monitor bottlenecks workflow-1234567890
   ```

3. Generate performance report:
   ```
   *report performance management quarterly
   ```

## Best Practices

### Workflow Design

1. Clearly define workflow phases and agent responsibilities
2. Use descriptive names for workflows and tasks
3. Plan for contingencies and rollback procedures

### Agent Coordination

1. Regularly balance workloads to prevent agent overload
2. Use handoff procedures to maintain context during transitions
3. Establish clear conflict resolution protocols

### Performance Monitoring

1. Regularly monitor system health and performance metrics
2. Set up alerts for critical performance thresholds
3. Use historical data to predict future performance

### Resource Management

1. Plan capacity based on projected workload demands
2. Optimize resource allocation to maximize utilization
3. Monitor resource usage to identify optimization opportunities

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Agent Overload**: Use `*balance-load` to redistribute workloads
2. **Resource Contention**: Use `*optimize resources` to improve allocation
3. **Workflow Delays**: Use `*monitor bottlenecks` to identify issues
4. **Agent Conflicts**: Use `*conflict-resolution` to mediate disputes

### Error Messages

- **"No available agent of type X found"**: Ensure agents of the required type are registered and available
- **"Resource allocation failed"**: Check resource availability and constraints
- **"Workflow not found"**: Verify workflow ID is correct and workflow exists
