# BMAD Framework Implementation Mapping

## 1. Introduction

This document maps the mathematical framework defined in the BMAD Mathematical Framework document to the actual implementation of the BMAD methodology. This mapping ensures that the theoretical foundations are correctly realized in practice.

## 2. Agent Mapping

### 2.1 Mathematical Definition
In the mathematical framework, an agent is defined as A = (ID, Role, Capabilities, State, Workload).

### 2.2 Implementation Mapping
In the BMAD implementation, agents are realized as:
- **ID**: Represented by the agent's unique identifier in the system (e.g., 'analyst1', 'architect1')
- **Role**: Defined in the agent's YAML configuration file (e.g., 'Business Analyst', 'Architect')
- **Capabilities**: Defined in the agent's YAML configuration under the 'capabilities' section
- **State**: Managed by the AgentCoordinator component in the orchestrator
- **Workload**: Tracked by the AgentCoordinator component

## 3. Agent Coordination Mapping

### 3.1 Mathematical Definition
The coordination protocol is defined as C = (Aₛ, Aₜ, Task, Context) with coordination function coordination: Agents × Agents × Tasks × Contexts → CoordinationResult.

### 3.2 Implementation Mapping
In the BMAD implementation, coordination is realized through:
- **Aₛ, Aₜ**: Source and target agents identified by their IDs
- **Task**: The task to be coordinated, passed as a parameter
- **Context**: Contextual information provided with the coordination request
- **CoordinationResult**: The result of the coordination operation

## 4. Workflow Mapping

### 4.1 Mathematical Definition
A workflow is defined as W = (ID, Name, Agents, Phases, Status) with each phase Pᵢ = (Name, Status, Agents, StartTime, EndTime).

### 4.2 Implementation Mapping
In the BMAD implementation, workflows are realized as:
- **ID**: Auto-generated workflow identifier (e.g., 'workflow-1234567890')
- **Name**: User-defined workflow name
- **Agents**: List of agent types involved in the workflow
- **Phases**: Array of workflow phases with status tracking
- **Status**: Current workflow status (active, paused, archived, etc.)

## 5. Memory System Mapping

### 5.1 Mathematical Definition
The memory system is defined as M = (MemoryEntries, AccessControl, ConsistencyModel) with each entry Eᵢ = (Key, Content, AgentRole, ProjectID, Timestamp).

### 5.2 Implementation Mapping
In the BMAD implementation, the memory system is realized through:
- **MemoryEntries**: Stored in the .ai/memory directory as JSON files
- **AccessControl**: Managed through agent role-based prefixes
- **ConsistencyModel**: Implemented through file-based storage with timestamping
- **Key, Content, AgentRole, ProjectID, Timestamp**: Fields in the stored memory entries

## 7. Conflict Resolution Mapping

### 7.1 Mathematical Definition
The conflict resolution model uses a game-theoretic approach with utility functions and seeks Nash equilibrium.

### 7.2 Implementation Mapping
In the BMAD implementation, conflict resolution is realized through:
