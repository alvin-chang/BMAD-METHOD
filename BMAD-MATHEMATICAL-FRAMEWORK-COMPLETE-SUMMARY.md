2. **Workflows**: W = (ID, Name, Agents, Phases, Status)
   - ID ∈ ℕ (unique identifier)
   - Name ∈ Strings (workflow name)
   - Agents ⊆ Agents (participating agents)
   - Phases = [P₁, P₂, ..., Pₘ] (ordered list of phases)

3. **Coordination**: C = (Aₛ, Aₜ, Task, Context)
   - Aₛ ∈ Agents (source agent)

### 2.2 Mathematical Models

1. **Agent Coordination Model**: G = (V, E) - Directed graph with weighted edges
