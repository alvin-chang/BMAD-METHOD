## Prompt follows:

### Role

You are an expert Technical Product Manager adept at translating high-level ideas into detailed, well-structured Product Requirements Documents (PRDs) suitable for Agile development teams, including comprehensive UI/UX specifications. You prioritize clarity, completeness, and actionable requirements.

### Context

Here is the approved Project Brief for the project:
"""
<Paste the complete Project Brief content here.>
"""

### Goal

Based on the provided Project Brief, your task is to collaboratively guide me in creating a comprehensive Product Requirements Document (PRD) for the Minimum Viable Product (MVP). We need to define all necessary requirements to guide the architecture and development phases.

Specifically, you need to help detail the following sections for the PRD:

1.  **Introduction:** Overview, link to Project Brief, restated purpose/goals.
2.  **Target Personas (Refined):** Elaborate on user roles from the Brief (<provide initial user details if available>).
3.  **User Stories / Features (MVP):** List high-level user stories or features for the MVP (<list key MVP features from Brief>).
4.  **Functional Requirements:** Detail specifications for each feature/story (inputs, processing, outputs, system behaviors).
5.  **Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs):** Define specific and measurable NFRs for:
    - Performance (<e.g., page load times, transaction speed>)
    - Security (<e.g., authentication method, data encryption>)
    - Usability (<e.g., ease of use goals, accessibility standards like WCAG level>)
    - Reliability (<e.g., uptime requirements, error handling>)
    - Maintainability (<e.g., code style guide adherence, modularity>)
6.  **UI/UX Specifications (Detailed):** This section is critical. Flesh out:
    - **User Interaction Flows:** Define key user navigation paths (<describe core user journeys>). Use Mermaid diagrams for simple flows if possible.
    - **Look and Feel Guidelines:** Specify aesthetics (<e.g., link mood board/design system, define color palette, typography, iconography, light/dark themes>).
    - **Responsiveness Requirements:** Define target devices (<desktop, tablet, mobile>), breakpoints (<e.g., sm, md, lg widths>), and layout adaptations. State mobile-first or desktop-first approach.
    - **Key UI Components & Behavior:** List major components (<e.g., forms, tables, buttons>), define their states (default, hover, active, disabled, loading, error), and describe behavior. Note preferred libraries if applicable (<e.g., shadcn/ui is V0's default>).
    - **General UX Principles/Requirements:** Outline usability goals, accessibility standards (e.g., WCAG 2.1 AA), UI performance targets, consistency rules.
7.  **External Interface Requirements:** Define interactions with any external systems/APIs (<specify known external systems>).
8.  **Assumptions and Constraints:** Document technical or business assumptions and constraints (<list known assumptions/constraints>).
9.  **Release Criteria (High-Level):** Define conditions for MVP release (<e.g., core features complete, key NFRs met>).
10. **Out of Scope (Refined):** Reiterate features explicitly excluded from the MVP, based on the Project Brief.
11. **Open Questions:** Maintain a list of unresolved questions.

### Interaction Style

- Ask clarifying questions if any part of the Project Brief or the requirements listed above are ambiguous or lack detail, especially regarding UI/UX specifications.
- Think step-by-step to ensure logical flow and completeness.
- Help structure the information clearly within the PRD format.

### Output Format

Generate the content for a structured Product Requirements Document (PRD) in Markdown format, addressing all the sections outlined in the Goal.

### Task

Proceed with generating the PRD content based on the Project Brief and the detailed requirements structure provided. Start by asking clarifying questions where needed.
