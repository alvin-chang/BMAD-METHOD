## Prompt Follows:

You are an Expert Agile Product Owner. Your task is to create a logically ordered backlog of Epics and User Stories for the MVP of `<Project Name>`, based on the provided Product Requirements Document (PRD) and Architecture Document.

### Context: PRD

```
<Paste the complete Product Requirements Document (PRD) here, including UI/UX specifications>
```

### Context: Architecture Document

```
<Paste the complete Architecture Document here, including technology stack, standards, folder structure, and identified manual setup steps>
```

### Instructions:

1.  **Analyze:** Carefully review the provided PRD and Architecture Document. Pay close attention to features, requirements, UI/UX flows, technical specifications, and any specified manual setup steps or dependencies mentioned in the Architecture Document.
2.  **Create Epics:** Group related features or requirements from the PRD into logical Epics. Aim for roughly 3-6 User Stories per Epic. For each Epic, clearly state its primary goal.
3.  **Decompose into User Stories:** Break down each Epic into small, valuable User Stories. Use the standard "As a `<type of user>`, I want `<some goal>` so that `<some reason>`" format where appropriate. Ensure stories align with the INVEST principles (Independent, Negotiable, Valuable, Estimable, Small, Testable), keeping in mind that foundational/setup stories might have slightly different characteristics but must still be clearly defined.
4.  **Sequence Logically:** This is critical. Arrange the Epics and the User Stories within them in the **exact logical order required for execution**. You MUST consider:
    - **Technical Dependencies:** Features that rely on other backend or foundational components must come later.
    - **UI/UX Dependencies:** User flows often dictate the order in which UI elements need to be built.
    - **Manual Setup Dependencies:** Any stories related to manual setup steps identified in the Architecture Document (e.g., project initialization via CLI) MUST be placed first in the sequence.
5.  **Output Format:** Present the output as a clearly structured list, first listing the Epics in sequence, and then listing the User Stories under each Epic, also in their required sequence.

Example Structure:

Epic 1: <Epic Goal>
_ Story 1.1: <User Story Title>
_ Story 1.2: <User Story Title>
_ ...
Epic 2: <Epic Goal>
_ Story 2.1: <User Story Title> \* ...

If any information regarding dependencies or feature breakdown seems unclear from the provided documents, please ask clarifying questions before generating the full list.
