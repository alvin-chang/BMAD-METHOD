# BMAD™ Orchestrator Demo Script

## Introduction

Welcome to the BMAD™ Orchestrator demo! In this comprehensive walkthrough, we'll explore the powerful capabilities of the enhanced BMAD™ Orchestrator, which provides advanced workflow management, agent coordination, performance monitoring, and resource optimization features.

The BMAD™ Orchestrator is a comprehensive system for managing multi-agent workflows, coordinating agent interactions, and optimizing resource allocation. It builds upon the core BMAD™ framework to provide enhanced capabilities for complex project management.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, ensure you have:
1. BMAD™ installed and configured
2. Access to the BMAD™ CLI
3. Basic understanding of BMAD™ agents and workflows

## Demo Structure

1. **Getting Started with the Orchestrator**
2. **Workflow Management**
3. **Agent Coordination**
4. **Performance Monitoring**
5. **Resource Optimization**
6. **Advanced Features**

## 1. Getting Started with the Orchestrator

Let's start by launching the orchestrator CLI:

```bash
npm run orchestrator
```

You should see a prompt where you can enter orchestrator commands. Let's first check what commands are available:

```
*help
```

This displays all available orchestrator commands, organized into categories:
- Core commands
- Workflow management
- Agent coordination

Let's check the current status of our orchestrator:

```
*status
```

This shows an overview dashboard with:
- Active workflows
- Available agents
- Allocated resources
- Active escalations

## 2. Workflow Management

### Creating a Workflow

Let's create a new workflow for developing an e-commerce platform:

```
*create-workflow "E-commerce Platform" analyst,architect,developer,tester,devops requirements,design,implementation,testing,deployment
```

The orchestrator responds with a success message and a workflow ID. Let's check our workflows:

```
*workflows
```

This lists all active workflows with their status, agents, and phases.

### Modifying a Workflow

We can modify workflow parameters as needed:

```
*modify-workflow workflow-1234567890 {"name": "Enhanced E-commerce Platform"}
```

### Pausing and Resuming Workflows

To pause a workflow:

```
*pause-workflow workflow-1234567890 "Waiting for client requirements clarification"
```

To resume a paused workflow:

```
*resume-workflow workflow-1234567890 {"status": "active"}
```

### Archiving Workflows

When a workflow is complete, we can archive it:

```
*archive-workflow workflow-1234567890 "Project completed successfully with all milestones achieved"
```

### Cloning Workflows

We can also clone existing workflows as templates:

```
*clone-workflow workflow-1234567890 {"name": "E-commerce Platform v2"}
```

## 3. Agent Coordination

### Listing Available Agents

Let's check what agents are available:

```
*agents
```

This shows all registered agents with their status and current workload.

### Delegating Tasks

We can delegate tasks to specific agents:

```
*delegate "Implement user authentication" developer "Frontend login component"
```

### Coordinating Agents

To coordinate between multiple agents:

```
*coordinate dev1,dev2,test1 "Implement and test user authentication" "2 days"
```

### Synchronizing Agents

To synchronize agents on a specific topic:

```
*sync-agents dev1,dev2,test1 "User authentication implementation" "daily-standup"
```

### Balancing Workloads

To balance workloads across agents:

```
*balance-load dev1,dev2,dev3 "even"
```

### Handing Off Work

To manage clean handoffs between agents:

```
*handoff dev1 test1 {"taskId": "auth-implementation", "description": "Handoff completed authentication implementation to testing"}
```

### Resolving Conflicts

To facilitate resolution of agent conflicts:

```
*conflict-resolution dev1,arch1 "Component design disagreement"
```

### Cross-Training Agents

To coordinate knowledge sharing:

```
*cross-training dev1,dev2 javascript,python
```

### Assigning Backup Agents

To set up backup arrangements:

```
*backup-assignment dev1 dev2
```

## 4. Performance Monitoring

### Monitoring System Health

To monitor system health:

```
*monitor health cpu,memory,disk
```

### Detecting Bottlenecks

To detect bottlenecks in workflows:

```
*monitor bottlenecks workflow-1234567890
```

### Predicting Delivery

To predict delivery timelines:

```
*monitor predict workflow-1234567890
```

### Assessing Risks

To assess risks in the current environment:

```
*monitor risks
```

## 5. Resource Optimization

### Checking Resource Status

To check available resources:

```
*resources
```

### Allocating Resources

To allocate resources to workflows:

```
*allocate compute1 workflow-1234567890
```

### Releasing Resources

To release resources when no longer needed:

```
*release compute1
```

### Optimizing Resource Allocation

To optimize resource allocation:

```
*optimize resources {"strategy": "load-balanced"}
```

### Planning Capacity

To plan capacity for upcoming workloads:

```
*optimize capacity {"workloads": ["project1", "project2", "project3"]}
```

## 6. Advanced Features

### Generating Reports

To generate performance reports:

```
*report performance management quarterly
```

### Escalating Issues

To escalate critical issues:

```
*escalate "Production server down" "Server is not responding to requests" "critical"
```

### Visualizing Workflows

To generate workflow visualizations:

```
*visualize workflow-1234567890
```

## Practical Example: Managing a Software Development Project

Let's walk through a practical example of managing a software development project using the orchestrator:

1. **Create a workflow** for the project:
   ```
   *create-workflow "Mobile Banking App" analyst,architect,developer,tester,devops requirements,design,implementation,testing,deployment
   ```

2. **Register agents** and check their status:
   ```
   *agents
   ```

3. **Assign initial tasks** to agents:
   ```
   *delegate "Gather requirements for account management" analyst "Mobile banking app requirements"
   ```

4. **Monitor progress** of the workflow:
   ```
   *status
   ```

5. **Handle issues** as they arise:
   ```
   *escalate "Database connection issues" "Unable to connect to production database" "high"
   ```

6. **Balance workloads** when needed:
   ```
   *balance-load dev1,dev2,dev3 "even"
   ```

7. **Coordinate handoffs** between development and testing:
   ```
   *handoff dev1 test1 {"taskId": "account-management", "description": "Handoff completed account management feature to testing"}
   ```

8. **Monitor performance** throughout the project:
   ```
   *monitor health cpu,memory,network
   ```

9. **Optimize resources** based on project demands:
   ```
   *optimize resources {"maxUtilization": 80}
   ```

10. **Generate reports** for stakeholders:
    ```
    *report performance management monthly
    ```

11. **Archive the workflow** when complete:
    ```
    *archive-workflow workflow-1234567890 "Mobile banking app successfully deployed to production"
    ```

## Best Practices

Throughout this demo, we've highlighted several best practices for using the BMAD™ Orchestrator:

1. **Regular Monitoring**: Continuously monitor system health and workflow progress
2. **Proactive Resource Management**: Plan capacity and optimize allocation before bottlenecks occur
3. **Effective Agent Coordination**: Use synchronization and handoff procedures to maintain context
4. **Timely Escalation**: Escalate issues quickly to prevent project delays
5. **Comprehensive Reporting**: Generate regular reports for stakeholders
6. **Workflow Lifecycle Management**: Properly archive workflows when complete

## Conclusion

The BMAD™ Orchestrator provides powerful capabilities for managing complex multi-agent workflows. By leveraging its workflow management, agent coordination, performance monitoring, and resource optimization features, you can effectively coordinate agent interactions and monitor performance across your projects.

We encourage you to experiment with the orchestrator in your own projects and explore its advanced features. For more information, please refer to the detailed documentation available in the BMAD™ framework.

Thank you for watching this demo, and we hope you enjoy using the BMAD™ Orchestrator!
