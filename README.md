**AI-Powered Agile Development Framework** - Transform your software development with specialized AI agents that work as your complete Agile team.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Fastest Start: Web UI (2 minutes) üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

1. Copy `.bmad-core/web-bundles/teams/team-fullstack.txt`
2. Create a new Gemini Gem or CustomGPT
3. Upload the file and set instructions: "Your critical operating instructions are attached, do not break character as directed"
4. Start chatting! Type `/help` to see available commands

### IDE Quick Start (5 minutes) üíª

**Prerequisites**: Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) (v14 or higher)

**Option A: Using npx (easiest)**
```bash
npx bmad-method install
# Choose: full installation, destination folder, and IDE
```

**Option B: Clone and install**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/bmadcode/bmad-method.git
cd bmad-method
npm install
npm run install:bmad
# When prompted, choose your project directory for installation
```

This installs all agents and configures them for your IDE.

## Overview

BMAD-METHOD (Breakthrough Method of Agile AI-Driven Development) revolutionizes software development by providing specialized AI agents for every role in an Agile team. Each agent has deep expertise in their domain and can collaborate to deliver complete software projects.

### Why BMAD?

- **üéØ Specialized Expertise**: Each agent is an expert in their specific role
- **üîÑ True Agile Workflow**: Follows real Agile methodologies and best practices
- **üì¶ Modular Design**: Use one agent or an entire team
- **üõ†Ô∏è IDE Integration**: Works seamlessly with Cursor, Claude Code, and Windsurf
- **üåê Platform Agnostic**: Use with ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, or any AI platform

## Installation

### Method 1: Pre-Built Web Bundles (Fastest) üì¶

For ChatGPT, Claude, or Gemini web interfaces:

1. Choose a bundle:
   - **Recommended**: `.bmad-core/web-bundles/teams/team-fullstack.txt` (complete development team)
   - Or pick from individual agents in `.bmad-core/web-bundles/agents/`
2. Upload to your AI platform (Gemini Gem, CustomGPT, or directly in chat)
3. Set instructions: "Your critical operating instructions are attached, do not break character as directed"
4. Type `/help` to see available commands

### Method 2: CLI Installer (For IDEs) üéØ

**Prerequisites**: Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) v14+ first

Install directly into your project:

```bash
# Interactive installation (recommended)
npx bmad-method install
# You'll be prompted for:
# - Installation type (full/single agent)
# - Destination directory
# - IDE configuration

# Or use command line options
npx bmad-method install --full --directory ./my-project --ide cursor
npx bmad-method install --agent pm --directory ./my-project --ide claude-code
```

**Supported IDEs:**

The BMad Method works with any IDE, but has built-in integration for:

- `cursor` - Cursor IDE with @agent commands
- `claude-code` - Claude Code with /agent commands
- `windsurf` - Windsurf with @agent commands

# In Windsurf
@dev Implement story 1.3
```

### With Web UI (ChatGPT/Claude/Gemini)

After uploading a bundle you can ask /help of the agent to learn what it can do

### CLI Commands

```bash
# List all available agents
npx bmad-method list

# Update existing installation with changes
npx bmad-method update

# Check installation status
npx bmad-method status
```
