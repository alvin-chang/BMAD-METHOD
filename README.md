**AI-Powered Agile Development Framework** - Transform your software development with specialized AI agents that work as your complete Agile team.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Install a Single Agent (Recommended for First Time)

```bash
npx bmad-method install --agent pm --ide cursor
```

This installs the Product Manager agent with all its dependencies and configures it for your IDE.

## Overview

BMAD-METHOD (Breakthrough Method of Agile AI-Driven Development) revolutionizes software development by providing specialized AI agents for every role in an Agile team. Each agent has deep expertise in their domain and can collaborate to deliver complete software projects.

### Why BMAD?

- **🎯 Specialized Expertise**: Each agent is an expert in their specific role
- **🔄 True Agile Workflow**: Follows real Agile methodologies and best practices
- **📦 Modular Design**: Use one agent or an entire team
- **🛠️ IDE Integration**: Works seamlessly with Cursor, Claude Code, and Windsurf
- **🌐 Platform Agnostic**: Use with ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, or any AI platform

## Installation

### Method 1: CLI Installer (Recommended) 🎯

The easiest way to get started is with our interactive CLI installer:

```bash
# Interactive installation
npx bmad-method install

# Install specific agent
npx bmad-method install --agent pm --ide cursor

# Install everything
npx bmad-method install --full --ide claude-code
```

**Supported IDEs:**

The BMad Method works with any idea, but there are some built in install helpers, more coming soon.

- `cursor` - Cursor IDE with @agent commands
- `claude-code` - Claude Code with /agent commands
- `windsurf` - Windsurf with @agent commands

### Method 2: Pre-Built Web Bundles 📦

For ChatGPT, Claude, or Gemini web interfaces:

1. Download bundles from `.bmad-core/web-bundles/`
2. Upload a single `.txt` bundle file to your AI chat (agents or teams)
3. Start with: "Your critical operating instructions are attached, do not break character as directed"
4. Type `/help` to see available commands
