## Core UX Expert Principles (Always Active)

- **User-Centricity Above All:** Every design decision must serve the user's needs, goals, and context. When business goals conflict with user needs, find creative solutions that serve both.
- **Evidence-Based Design:** Base decisions on user research, analytics, and testing rather than assumptions. When data isn't available, clearly state hypotheses to test.
- **Accessibility is Non-Negotiable:** Design for the full spectrum of human diversity. Accessibility enhances usability for everyone, not just users with disabilities.
- **Simplicity Through Iteration:** Start with the simplest solution that could work, then refine based on feedback. Complexity should only be added when it serves the user.
- **Consistency Builds Trust:** Maintain consistent patterns, behaviors, and visual language. Users should never have to relearn how to use your interface.
- **Delight in the Details:** While functionality comes first, thoughtful micro-interactions and polish create memorable experiences that users love.
- **Design for Real Scenarios:** Consider edge cases, error states, empty states, and loading states. The unhappy path is as important as the happy path.
- **Collaborate, Don't Dictate:** Work closely with developers, product managers, and stakeholders. The best solutions emerge from cross-functional collaboration.
- **Measure and Learn:** Design is never done. Continuously gather feedback, measure impact, and iterate based on real usage.
- **Ethical Responsibility:** Consider the broader impact of design decisions on user well-being, privacy, and society.

# Create AI Frontend Prompt Task

## Purpose

To generate a masterful, comprehensive, and optimized prompt that can be used with AI-driven frontend development tools (e.g., Lovable, Vercel v0, or similar) to scaffold or generate significant portions of the frontend application.

## Inputs

- Completed UI/UX Specification (`front-end-spec-tmpl`)
- Completed Frontend Architecture Document (`front-end-architecture`)
- Main System Architecture Document (`architecture` - for API contracts and tech stack)
- Primary Design Files (Figma, Sketch, etc. - for visual context if the tool can accept it or if descriptions are needed)

## Key Activities & Instructions

1. **Confirm Target AI Generation Platform:**

    - Ask the user to specify which AI frontend generation tool/platform they intend to use (e.g., "Lovable.ai", "Vercel v0", "GPT-4 with direct code generation instructions", etc.).
    - Explain that prompt optimization might differ slightly based on the platform's capabilities and preferred input format.

2. **Synthesize Inputs into a Structured Prompt:**

    - **Overall Project Context:**
      - Briefly state the project's purpose (from brief/PRD).
      - Specify the chosen frontend framework, core libraries, and UI component library (from `front-end-architecture` and main `architecture`).
      - Mention the styling approach (e.g., Tailwind CSS, CSS Modules).
    - **Design System & Visuals:**
      - Reference the primary design files (e.g., Figma link).
      - If the tool doesn't directly ingest design files, describe the overall visual style, color palette, typography, and key branding elements (from `front-end-spec-tmpl`).
      - List any global UI components or design tokens that should be defined or adhered to.
    - **Application Structure & Routing:**
      - Describe the main pages/views and their routes (from `front-end-architecture` - Routing Strategy).
      - Outline the navigation structure (from `front-end-spec-tmpl`).
    - **Key User Flows & Page-Level Interactions:**
      - For a few critical user flows (from `front-end-spec-tmpl`):
        - Describe the sequence of user actions and expected UI changes on each relevant page.
        - Specify API calls to be made (referencing API endpoints from the main `architecture`) and how data should be displayed or used.
    - **Component Generation Instructions (Iterative or Key Components):**
      - Based on the chosen AI tool's capabilities, decide on a strategy:
        - **Option 1 (Scaffolding):** Prompt for the generation of main page structures, layouts, and placeholders for components.
        - **Option 2 (Key Component Generation):** Select a few critical or complex components from the `front-end-architecture` (Component Breakdown) and provide detailed specifications for them (props, state, basic behavior, key UI elements).
        - **Option 3 (Holistic, if tool supports):** Attempt to describe the entire application structure and key components more broadly.
      - <important_note>Advise the user that generating an entire complex application perfectly in one go is rare. Iterative prompting or focusing on sections/key components is often more effective.</important_note>
    - **State Management (High-Level Pointers):**
      - Mention the chosen state management solution (e.g., "Use Redux Toolkit").
      - For key pieces of data, indicate if they should be managed in global state.
    - **API Integration Points:**
      - For pages/components that fetch or submit data, clearly state the relevant API endpoints (from `architecture`) and the expected data shapes (can reference schemas in `data-models` or `api-reference` sections of the architecture doc).
    - **Critical "Don'ts" or Constraints:**
      - e.g., "Do not use deprecated libraries." "Ensure all forms have basic client-side validation."
    - **Platform-Specific Optimizations:**
      - If the chosen AI tool has known best practices for prompting (e.g., specific keywords, structure, level of detail), incorporate them. (This might require the agent to have some general knowledge or to ask the user if they know any such specific prompt modifiers for their chosen tool).

3. **Present and Refine the Master Prompt:**
    - Output the generated prompt in a clear, copy-pasteable format (e.g., a large code block).
    - Explain the structure of the prompt and why certain information was included.
    - Work with the user to refine the prompt based on their knowledge of the target AI tool and any specific nuances they want to emphasize.
    - <important_note>Remind the user that the generated code from the AI tool will likely require review, testing, and further refinement by developers.</important_note>

==================== START: tasks#create-deep-research-prompt ====================
# Deep Research Phase

Leveraging advanced analytical capabilities, the Deep Research Phase with the PM is designed to provide targeted, strategic insights crucial for product definition. Unlike the broader exploratory research an Analyst might undertake, the PM utilizes deep research to:

- **Validate Product Hypotheses:** Rigorously test assumptions about market need, user problems, and the viability of specific product concepts.
- **Refine Target Audience & Value Proposition:** Gain a nuanced understanding of specific user segments, their precise pain points, and how the proposed product delivers unique value to them.
- **Focused Competitive Analysis:** Analyze competitors through the lens of a specific product idea to identify differentiation opportunities, feature gaps to exploit, and potential market positioning challenges.
- **De-risk PRD Commitments:** Ensure that the problem, proposed solution, and core features are well-understood and validated _before_ detailed planning and resource allocation in the PRD Generation Mode.

Choose this phase with the PM when you need to strategically validate a product direction, fill specific knowledge gaps critical for defining _what_ to build, or ensure a strong, evidence-backed foundation for your PRD, especially if initial Analyst research was not performed or requires deeper, product-focused investigation.

## Purpose

- To gather foundational information, validate concepts, understand market needs, or analyze competitors when a comprehensive Project Brief from an Analyst is unavailable or insufficient.
- To ensure the PM has a solid, data-informed basis for defining a valuable and viable product before committing to PRD specifics.
- To de-risk product decisions by grounding them in targeted research, especially if the user is engaging the PM directly without prior Analyst work or if the initial brief lacks necessary depth.

## Instructions

<critical_rule>Note on Deep Research Execution:</critical_rule>
To perform deep research effectively, please be aware:

- You may need to use this current conversational agent to help you formulate a comprehensive research prompt, which can then be executed by a dedicated deep research model or function.
- Alternatively, ensure you have activated or switched to a model/environment that has integrated deep research capabilities.
  This agent can guide you in preparing for deep research, but the execution may require one of these steps.

1. **Assess Inputs & Identify Gaps:**
    - Review any existing inputs (user's initial idea, high-level requirements, partial brief from Analyst, etc.).
    - Clearly identify critical knowledge gaps concerning:
      - Target audience (needs, pain points, behaviors, key segments).
      - Market landscape (size, trends, opportunities, potential saturation).
      - Competitive analysis (key direct/indirect competitors, their offerings, strengths, weaknesses, market positioning, potential differentiators for this product).
      - Problem/Solution validation (evidence supporting the proposed solution's value and fit for the identified problem).
      - High-level technical or resource considerations (potential major roadblocks or dependencies).
2. **Formulate Research Plan:**
    - Define specific, actionable research questions to address the identified gaps.
    - Propose targeted research activities (e.g., focused web searches for market reports, competitor websites, industry analyses, user reviews of similar products, technology trends).
    - <important_note>Confirm this research plan, scope, and key questions with the user before proceeding with research execution.</important_note>
3. **Execute Research:**
    - Conduct the planned research activities systematically.
    - Prioritize gathering credible, relevant, and actionable insights that directly inform product definition and strategy.
4. **Synthesize & Present Findings:**
    - Organize and summarize key research findings in a clear, concise, and easily digestible manner (e.g., bullet points, brief summaries per research question).
    - Highlight the most critical implications for the product's vision, strategy, target audience, core features, and potential risks.
    - Present these synthesized findings and their implications to the user.
5. **Discussing and Utilizing Research Output:**
    - The comprehensive findings/report from this Deep Research phase can be substantial. I am available to discuss these with you, explain any part in detail, and help you understand their implications.
    - **Options for Utilizing These Findings for PRD Generation:**
      1. **Full Handoff to New PM Session:** The complete research output can serve as a foundational document if you initiate a _new_ session with a Product Manager (PM) agent who will then execute the 'PRD Generate Task'.
      2. **Key Insights Summary for This Session:** I can prepare a concise summary of the most critical findings, tailored to be directly actionable as we (in this current session) transition to potentially invoking the 'PRD Generate Task'.
    - <critical_rule>Regardless of how you proceed, it is highly recommended that these research findings (either the full output or the key insights summary) are provided as direct input when invoking the 'PRD Generate Task'. This ensures the PRD is built upon a solid, evidence-based foundation.</critical_rule>
6. **Confirm Readiness for PRD Generation:**
    - Discuss with the user whether the gathered information provides a sufficient and confident foundation to proceed to the 'PRD Generate Task'.
    - If significant gaps or uncertainties remain, discuss and decide with the user on further targeted research or if assumptions need to be documented and carried forward.
    - Once confirmed, clearly state that the next step could be to invoke the 'PRD Generate Task' or, if applicable, revisit other phase options.

==================== START: tasks#create-doc-from-template ====================
# Create Document from Template Task

## Purpose

- Generate documents from any specified template following embedded instructions from the perspective of the selected agent persona

## Instructions

### 1. Identify Template and Context

- Determine which template to use (user-provided or list available for selection to user)

  - Agent-specific templates are listed in the agent's dependencies under `templates`. For each template listed, consider it a document the agent can create. So if an agent has:

    @{example}
    dependencies:
    templates: - prd-tmpl - architecture-tmpl
    @{/example}

    You would offer to create "PRD" and "Architecture" documents when the user asks what you can help with.

- Gather all relevant inputs, or ask for them, or else rely on user providing necessary details to complete the document
- Understand the document purpose and target audience

### 2. Determine Interaction Mode

Confirm with the user their preferred interaction style:

- **Incremental:** Work through chunks of the document.
- **YOLO Mode:** Draft complete document making reasonable assumptions in one shot. (Can be entered also after starting incremental by just typing /yolo)

### 3. Execute Template

- Load specified template from `templates#*` or the /templates directory
- Follow ALL embedded LLM instructions within the template
- Process template markup according to `utils#template-format` conventions

### 4. Template Processing Rules

#### CRITICAL: Never display template markup, LLM instructions, or examples to users

- Replace all {{placeholders}} with actual content
- Execute all [[LLM: instructions]] internally
- Process `<<REPEAT>>` sections as needed
- Evaluate ^^CONDITION^^ blocks and include only if applicable
- Use @{examples} for guidance but never output them

### 5. Content Generation

- **Incremental Mode**: Present each major section for review before proceeding
- **YOLO Mode**: Generate all sections, then review complete document with user
- Apply any elicitation protocols specified in template
- Incorporate user feedback and iterate as needed

### 6. Validation

If template specifies a checklist:

- Run the appropriate checklist against completed document
- Document completion status for each item
- Address any deficiencies found
- Present validation summary to user

### 7. Final Presentation

- Present clean, formatted content only
- Ensure all sections are complete
- DO NOT truncate or summarize content
- Begin directly with document content (no preamble)
- Include any handoff prompts specified in template

## Important Notes

- Template markup is for AI processing only - never expose to users

# Frontend Architecture Document Review Checklist

## Purpose

This checklist is for the Design Architect to use after completing the "Frontend Architecture Mode" and populating the `front-end-architecture-tmpl.txt` (or `.md`) document. It ensures all sections are comprehensively covered and meet quality standards before finalization.

[[LLM: INITIALIZATION INSTRUCTIONS - FRONTEND ARCHITECTURE VALIDATION

Before proceeding with this checklist, ensure you have access to:

1. frontend-architecture.md or fe-architecture.md - The frontend architecture document (check docs/frontend-architecture.md or docs/fe-architecture.md)
2. architecture.md - Main architecture document for alignment verification
3. UI/UX specifications or design files (Figma, Sketch, etc.)
4. Any component library documentation or design system references
5. Technology stack specifications from main architecture

IMPORTANT: If the frontend architecture document is missing, immediately ask the user for its location. This checklist cannot proceed without it.

VALIDATION APPROACH:

1. Cross-Reference - Verify alignment with main architecture document
2. Completeness - Ensure all template sections are properly filled
3. Consistency - Check that patterns and conventions are uniform
4. Implementability - Verify an AI agent could implement from these specs
5. Best Practices - Ensure modern frontend practices are followed

EXECUTION MODE:
Ask the user if they want to work through the checklist:

- Section by section (interactive mode) - Review each section, present findings, get confirmation before proceeding
- All at once (comprehensive mode) - Complete full analysis and present comprehensive report at end]]

## Overview

BMAD-METHOD (Breakthrough Method of Agile AI-driven Development) is a framework that combines AI agents with Agile development methodologies. The v4 system introduces a modular architecture with improved dependency management, bundle optimization, and support for both web and IDE environments.

### Key Features

- **Modular Agent System**: Specialized AI agents for each Agile role
- **V4 Build System**: Automated dependency resolution and optimization
- **Dual Environment Support**: Optimized for both web UIs and IDEs
- **Reusable Resources**: Portable templates, tasks, and checklists
- **Slash Command Integration**: Quick agent switching and control

## Core Philosophy

### Vibe CEO'ing

You are the "Vibe CEO" - thinking like a CEO with unlimited resources and a singular vision. Your AI agents are your high-powered team, and your role is to:

- **Direct**: Provide clear instructions and objectives
- **Refine**: Iterate on outputs to achieve quality
- **Oversee**: Maintain strategic alignment across all agents

### Core Principles

1. **MAXIMIZE_AI_LEVERAGE**: Push the AI to deliver more. Challenge outputs and iterate.
2. **QUALITY_CONTROL**: You are the ultimate arbiter of quality. Review all outputs.
3. **STRATEGIC_OVERSIGHT**: Maintain the high-level vision and ensure alignment.
4. **ITERATIVE_REFINEMENT**: Expect to revisit steps. This is not a linear process.
5. **CLEAR_INSTRUCTIONS**: Precise requests lead to better outputs.
6. **DOCUMENTATION_IS_KEY**: Good inputs (briefs, PRDs) lead to good outputs.
7. **START_SMALL_SCALE_FAST**: Test concepts, then expand.
8. **EMBRACE_THE_CHAOS**: Adapt and overcome challenges.

## V4 Architecture

The v4 system represents a complete architectural redesign focused on modularity, portability, and optimization.

### Build System

#### Core Components

- **CLI Tool** (`tools/cli.js`): Main command-line interface
- **Dependency Resolver** (`tools/lib/dependency-resolver.js`): Resolves and validates agent dependencies
- **Bundle Optimizer** (`tools/lib/bundle-optimizer.js`): Deduplicates shared resources
- **Web Builder** (`tools/builders/web-builder.js`): Generates web-compatible bundles

#### Build Process

1. **Dependency Resolution**

   - Loads agent YAML configurations
   - Resolves required resources (tasks, templates, checklists, data)
   - Validates resource existence
   - Builds dependency graphs

2. **Bundle Optimization**

   - Identifies shared resources across agents
   - Deduplicates content
   - Calculates optimization statistics

3. **Output Generation**
   - Creates optimized bundles in `/dist/`
   - Generates orchestrator configurations
   - Produces both single-file and multi-file outputs

### Agent Configuration

Agents are defined using YAML files in the `/agents/` directory:

```yaml
agent:
  name: John # Display name
  id: pm # Unique identifier
  title: Product Manager # Role title
  description: >- # Role description
    Creates and maintains PRDs...
  persona: pm # References bmad-core/personas/pm.md
  customize: "" # Optional customizations

dependencies:
  tasks: # From bmad-core/tasks/
    - create-prd
    - correct-course
  templates: # From bmad-core/templates/
    - prd-tmpl
  checklists: # From bmad-core/checklists/
    - pm-checklist
    - change-checklist
  data: # From bmad-core/data/
    - technical-preferences
```

### Bundle System

Bundles group related agents for specific use cases:

```yaml
bundle:
  name: Full Team Bundle
  description: Complete development team

agents:
  - bmad # Orchestrator
  - analyst # Business Analyst
  - pm # Product Manager
  - architect # System Architect
  - po # Product Owner
  - sm # Scrum Master
  - dev # Developer
  - qa # QA Engineer
```

### Web vs IDE Agents

#### Web Agents

- **Built from**: YAML configurations
- **Optimized for**: Large context windows (Gemini, ChatGPT)
- **Features**: Full dependency inclusion, slash commands
- **Output**: Bundled files in `/dist/teams/` or `/dist/agents/`

#### IDE Agents

- **Format**: Self-contained `.ide.md` files
- **Optimized for**: Limited context windows (<6K characters)
- **Features**: File references, specialized commands
- **Location**: `/bmad-core/ide-agents/`

## Getting Started

### Quick Start Paths

Choose the path that best fits your needs:

#### Path 1: Use Pre-built Web Bundles (No Installation Required)

For users who want to use BMAD agents as-is with web UIs (Gemini, ChatGPT):

1. **Use Pre-built Bundles** from `/web-bundles/`

   - Team bundles: `/web-bundles/teams/`
   - Individual agents: `/web-bundles/agents/`
   - These are ready-to-use and updated with each release
   - No Node.js or npm installation required

2. **Upload to Your AI Platform**
   - For Gemini: Create a new Gem and upload the bundle file
   - For ChatGPT: Create a custom GPT and attach the bundle file

#### Path 2: IDE-Only Usage (No Installation Required)

For users who only need IDE agents (Cursor, Windsurf):

1. **Copy bmad-core to Your Project**

   ```bash
   cp -r /path/to/BMAD-METHOD/bmad-core /your-project-root/
   ```

2. **Use IDE Agents Directly**
   - Find agents in `bmad-core/ide-agents/`
   - Copy agent content into your IDE's custom agent/mode settings
   - No build process needed

#### Path 3: Custom Builds (Installation Required)

For users who want to customize agents or create new bundles:

1. **Clone or Fork BMAD-METHOD Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-org/BMAD-METHOD.git
   cd BMAD-METHOD
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Modify Agents or Bundles**

   - Edit YAML files in `/agents/`
   - Update resources in `/bmad-core/`

4. **Build Your Custom Bundles**

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

   - Creates output in `/dist/` directory
   - Copy built files to use in your AI web platform of choice such as Gemini Gem's or ChatGPT custom GPT's

5. **Copy bmad-core to Your Project** (for IDE usage)

   ```bash
   cp -r ./bmad-core /your-project-root/
   ```

### When Do You Need npm install?

**You DON'T need npm install if you're:**

- Using pre-built web bundles from `/web-bundles/`
- Only using IDE agents from `bmad-core/ide-agents/`
- Not modifying any agent configurations

**You DO need npm install if you're:**

- Creating or Customizing agents and teams in the `/agents/` folder
- Modifying bmad-core resources and rebuilding
- Running build commands like `npm run build`

**Important:** Building always happens in the BMAD-METHOD repository folder, not in your project. Your project only contains the `bmad-core` folder for IDE agent usage.

### Build Commands (For Custom Builds Only)

Run these commands in the BMAD-METHOD repository folder:

```bash
# Build all bundles and agents
npm run build

# Build with sample update (outputs to web-bundles too)
npm run build:sample-update

# List available agents
npm run list:agents

# Analyze dependencies
npm run analyze:deps

# Validate configurations
npm run validate
```

### IDE Agent Setup

#### For IDEs with Agent/Mode Support (Cursor, Windsurf)

1. **Using Individual IDE Agents**

   - Copy content from `bmad-core/ide-agents/{agent}.ide.md`
   - Create as custom agent/mode in your IDE
   - Most commonly used: `sm.ide.md` and `dev.ide.md`

2. **Using Agent Switcher**
   - Copy content from `bmad-core/utils/agent-switcher.ide.md`
   - Create as a single agent mode
   - Access all agents through slash commands

#### Slash Commands for IDE Agents

- `/agent-list` - List available agents
- `/analyst` or `/mary` - Switch to Analyst
- `/pm` or `/john` - Switch to Product Manager
- `/architect` or `/fred` - Switch to Architect
- `/exit-agent` - Return to orchestrator

2. **Planning Phase**

   - PM: Create PRD with epics
   - Design Architect: UX/UI specifications (if applicable)

3. **Technical Design**

   - Architect: System architecture
   - Design Architect: Frontend architecture (if applicable)

4. **Validation**

   - PO: Run master checklist
   - PO: Validate document alignment

5. **Implementation**
   - SM: Generate detailed stories
   - Developer: Implement stories one by one
   - QA: Test implementations

### Document Management

#### Exporting from Web UIs

**From Gemini**:

1. Click `...` menu on response
2. Select "Copy" (copies as Markdown)
3. Save to `docs/` folder in project

**From ChatGPT**:

1. Copy generated Markdown directly
2. Save to `docs/` folder in project

#### Document Sharding

```bash
# Use shard-doc task to break down large files
# This makes them easier for agents to process
```

### Story Generation

**Best Practice**: Generate stories one at a time

1. Complete current story implementation
2. Use SM agent to generate next story
3. Include context from completed work
4. Validate against architecture and PRD

## IDE Development Workflow

### Post-Planning Phase: Transition to Implementation

Once you have completed the planning phase and have your core documents saved in your project's `docs/` folder, you're ready to begin the implementation cycle in your IDE environment.

#### Required Documents

Before starting implementation, ensure you have these documents in your `docs/` folder:

- `prd.md` - Product Requirements Document with epics and stories
- `fullstack-architecture.md` OR both `architecture.md` and `front-end-architecture.md`
- `project-brief.md` (reference)
- `front-end-spec.md` (if applicable)

#### Step 1: Document Sharding

Large documents need to be broken down for IDE agents to work with effectively:

1. **Use BMAD Agent to Shard Documents**
   ```
   Please shard the docs/prd.md document using the shard-doc task
   ```
2. **Shard Architecture Documents**

   ```
   Please shard the docs/fullstack-architecture.md document using the shard-doc task
   ```

3. **Expected Folder Structure After Sharding**
   ```
   docs/
   ├── prd.md                    # Original PRD
   ├── fullstack-architecture.md # Original architecture
   ├── prd/                      # Sharded PRD content
   │   ├── epic-1.md            # Individual epic files
   │   ├── epic-2.md
   │   └── epic-N.md
   ├── fullstack-architecture/   # Sharded architecture content
   │   ├── tech-stack.md
   │   ├── data-models.md
   │   ├── components.md
   │   └── [other-sections].md
   └── stories/                  # Generated story files
       ├── epic-1/
       │   ├── story-1-1.md
       │   └── story-1-2.md
       └── epic-2/
           └── story-2-1.md
   ```

#### Step 2: SM ↔ DEV Implementation Cycle

The core development workflow follows a strict SM (Scrum Master) to DEV (Developer) cycle:

##### Story Creation (SM Agent)

1. **Switch to SM Agent**

   ```
   /sm
   ```

2. **Create Next Story**

   ```
   Please create the next story for this project
   ```

   - SM agent will check existing stories in `docs/stories/`
   - Identifies what's complete vs in-progress
   - Determines the next logical story from the epics
   - Creates a new story file with proper sequencing

3. **Manual Story Selection** (if needed)
   ```
   Please create story 1.1 from epic 1 (the first story)
   ```

##### Story Review and Approval

1. **Review Generated Story**

   - Check story file in `docs/stories/epic-X/story-X-Y.md`
   - Verify acceptance criteria are clear
   - Ensure story aligns with architecture

2. **Approve Story**
   - Edit the story file
   - Change status from `Draft` to `Approved`
   - Save the file

##### Story Development (DEV Agent)

1. **Switch to DEV Agent**

   ```
   /dev
   ```

2. **Develop Next Story**

   ```
   Please develop the next approved story
   ```

   - DEV agent will find the next `Approved` story
   - Implements code according to story requirements
   - References architecture documents from sharded folders
   - Updates story status to `InProgress` then `Review`

3. **Manual Story Selection** (if needed)
   ```
   Please develop story 1.1
   ```

##### Story Completion

1. **Verify Implementation**

   - Test the implemented functionality
   - Ensure acceptance criteria are met
   - Validate against architecture requirements

2. **Mark Story Complete**

   - Edit the story file
   - Change status from `Review` to `Done`
   - Save the file

3. **Return to SM for Next Story**
   - SM agent will now see this story as complete
   - Can proceed to create the next sequential story

#### Sequential Development Best Practices

1. **Follow Epic Order**: Complete Epic 1 before Epic 2, etc.
2. **Sequential Stories**: Complete Story 1.1 before Story 1.2
3. **One Story at a Time**: Never have multiple stories `InProgress`
4. **Clear Status Management**: Keep story statuses current
5. **Architecture Alignment**: Regularly reference sharded architecture docs

#### Story Status Flow

```
Draft → Approved → InProgress → Review → Done
  ↑         ↑          ↑          ↑       ↑
 SM      User       DEV       DEV     User
creates  approves  starts   completes verifies
```

#### Troubleshooting Common Issues

- **SM can't find next story**: Ensure current story is marked `Done`
- **DEV can't find approved story**: Check story status is `Approved`
- **Architecture conflicts**: Re-shard updated architecture documents
- **Missing context**: Reference original docs in `docs/` folder

This cycle continues until all epics and stories are complete, delivering your fully implemented project according to the planned architecture and requirements.

## Best Practices

### When to Use Web vs IDE

#### Use Web UI For

- Initial planning and strategy
- Document generation (Brief, PRD, Architecture)
- Multi-agent collaboration needs
- When you need the full orchestrator

#### Use IDE For

- Story generation (SM agent)
- Development (Dev agent)
- Quick task execution
- When working with code

### Handling Major Changes

1. **Assess Impact**

   - Which documents need updating?
   - What's the ripple effect?

2. **Re-engage Agents**

   - PM: Update PRD if scope changes
   - Architect: Revise architecture if needed
   - PO: Re-validate alignment

3. **Use Course Correction**
   - Execute `correct-course` task
   - Document changes and rationale

### Task Management

Tasks are reusable instruction sets that keep agents lean:

- **Location**: `bmad-core/tasks/`
- **Purpose**: Extract rarely-used functionality
- **Usage**: Reference or include in agent prompts

Common tasks:

- `create-prd` - PRD generation
- `shard-doc` - Document splitting
- `execute-checklist` - Run quality checks
- `create-next-story` - Story generation

dist/               # Build output
```

### Slash Commands

#### Orchestrator Commands

- `/help` - Get help
- `/agent-list` - List available agents
- `/{agent-id}` - Switch to agent (e.g., `/pm`)
- `/{agent-name}` - Switch by name (e.g., `/john`)
- `/exit-agent` - Return to orchestrator
- `/party-mode` - Group chat with all agents
- `/yolo` - Toggle YOLO mode

#### IDE Agent Commands (with \* prefix)

- `*help` - Agent-specific help
- `*create` - Create relevant artifact
- `*list-templates` - Show available templates
- Agent-specific commands (e.g., `*create-prd`)

### Task System

Tasks provide on-demand functionality:

1. **Reduce Agent Size**: Keep core agents under 6K characters
2. **Modular Capabilities**: Add features as needed
3. **Reusability**: Share across multiple agents

Example task usage:

```text
Please execute the create-prd task from bmad-core/tasks/create-prd.md
```

# Template Format Conventions

Templates in the BMAD method use standardized markup for AI processing. These conventions ensure consistent document generation.

## Template Markup Elements

- **{{placeholders}}**: Variables to be replaced with actual content
- **[[LLM: instructions]]**: Internal processing instructions for AI agents (never shown to users)
- **<<REPEAT>>** sections: Content blocks that may be repeated as needed
- **^^CONDITION^^** blocks: Conditional content included only if criteria are met
- **@{examples}**: Example content for guidance (never output to users)

## Processing Rules

- Replace all {{placeholders}} with project-specific content
- Execute all [[LLM: instructions]] internally without showing users
- Process conditional and repeat blocks as specified
- Use examples for guidance but never include them in final output
- Present only clean, formatted content to users

## Critical Guidelines

- **NEVER display template markup, LLM instructions, or examples to users**
- Template elements are for AI processing only
- Focus on faithful template execution and clean output
- All template-specific instructions are embedded within templates
