==================== START: tasks#create-doc-from-template ====================
# Create Document from Template Task

## Purpose

- Generate documents from any specified template following embedded instructions from the perspective of the selected agent persona

## Instructions

### 1. Identify Template and Context

- Determine which template to use (user-provided or list available for selection to user)

  - Agent-specific templates are listed in the agent's dependencies under `templates`. For each template listed, consider it a document the agent can create. So if an agent has:

    @{example}
    dependencies:
    templates: - prd-tmpl - architecture-tmpl
    @{/example}

    You would offer to create "PRD" and "Architecture" documents when the user asks what you can help with.

- Gather all relevant inputs, or ask for them, or else rely on user providing necessary details to complete the document
- Understand the document purpose and target audience

### 2. Determine Interaction Mode

Confirm with the user their preferred interaction style:

- **Incremental:** Work through chunks of the document.
- **YOLO Mode:** Draft complete document making reasonable assumptions in one shot. (Can be entered also after starting incremental by just typing /yolo)

### 3. Execute Template

- Load specified template from `templates#*` or the /templates directory
- Follow ALL embedded LLM instructions within the template
- Process template markup according to `utils#template-format` conventions

### 4. Template Processing Rules

#### CRITICAL: Never display template markup, LLM instructions, or examples to users

- Replace all {{placeholders}} with actual content
- Execute all [[LLM: instructions]] internally
- Process `<<REPEAT>>` sections as needed
- Evaluate ^^CONDITION^^ blocks and include only if applicable
- Use @{examples} for guidance but never output them

### 5. Content Generation

- **Incremental Mode**: Present each major section for review before proceeding
- **YOLO Mode**: Generate all sections, then review complete document with user
- Apply any elicitation protocols specified in template
- Incorporate user feedback and iterate as needed

### 6. Validation

If template specifies a checklist:

- Run the appropriate checklist against completed document
- Document completion status for each item
- Address any deficiencies found
- Present validation summary to user

### 7. Final Presentation

- Present clean, formatted content only
- Ensure all sections are complete
- DO NOT truncate or summarize content
- Begin directly with document content (no preamble)
- Include any handoff prompts specified in template

## Important Notes

- Template markup is for AI processing only - never expose to users

==================== END: tasks#create-doc-from-template ====================

==================== START: tasks#create-next-story ====================
# Create Next Story Task

## Purpose

To identify the next logical story based on project progress and epic definitions, and then to prepare a comprehensive, self-contained, and actionable story file using the `Story Template`. This task ensures the story is enriched with all necessary technical context, requirements, and acceptance criteria, making it ready for efficient implementation by a Developer Agent with minimal need for additional research.

## Inputs for this Task

- Access to the project's documentation repository, specifically:
  - `docs/index.md` (hereafter "Index Doc")
  - All Epic files (e.g., `docs/epic-{n}.md` - hereafter "Epic Files")
  - Existing story files in `docs/stories/`
  - Main PRD (hereafter "PRD Doc")
  - Main Architecture Document (hereafter "Main Arch Doc")
  - Frontend Architecture Document (hereafter "Frontend Arch Doc," if relevant)
  - Project Structure Guide (`docs/project-structure.md`)
  - Operational Guidelines Document (`docs/operational-guidelines.md`)
  - Technology Stack Document (`docs/tech-stack.md`)
  - Data Models Document (as referenced in Index Doc)
  - API Reference Document (as referenced in Index Doc)
  - UI/UX Specifications, Style Guides, Component Guides (if relevant, as referenced in Index Doc)
- The `bmad-core/templates/story-tmpl.md` (hereafter "Story Template")
- The `bmad-core/checklists/story-draft-checklist.md` (hereafter "Story Draft Checklist")
- User confirmation to proceed with story identification and, if needed, to override warnings about incomplete prerequisite stories.

## Task Execution Instructions

### 1. Identify Next Story for Preparation

- Review `docs/stories/` to find the highest-numbered story file.
- **If a highest story file exists (`{lastEpicNum}.{lastStoryNum}.story.md`):**

  - Verify its `Status` is 'Done' (or equivalent).
  - If not 'Done', present an alert to the user:

    ```plaintext
    ALERT: Found incomplete story:
    File: {lastEpicNum}.{lastStoryNum}.story.md
    Status: [current status]

    Would you like to:
    1. View the incomplete story details (instructs user to do so, agent does not display)
    2. Cancel new story creation at this time
    3. Accept risk & Override to create the next story in draft

    Please choose an option (1/2/3):
    ```

  - Proceed only if user selects option 3 (Override) or if the last story was 'Done'.
  - If proceeding: Check the Epic File for `{lastEpicNum}` for a story numbered `{lastStoryNum + 1}`. If it exists and its prerequisites (per Epic File) are met, this is the next story.
  - Else (story not found or prerequisites not met): The next story is the first story in the next Epic File (e.g., `docs/epic-{lastEpicNum + 1}.md`, then `{lastEpicNum + 2}.md`, etc.) whose prerequisites are met.

- **If no story files exist in `docs/stories/`:**
  - The next story is the first story in `docs/epic-1.md` (then `docs/epic-2.md`, etc.) whose prerequisites are met.
- If no suitable story with met prerequisites is found, report to the user that story creation is blocked, specifying what prerequisites are pending. HALT task.
- Announce the identified story to the user: "Identified next story for preparation: {epicNum}.{storyNum} - {Story Title}".

### 2. Gather Core Story Requirements (from Epic File)

- For the identified story, open its parent Epic File.
- Extract: Exact Title, full Goal/User Story statement, initial list of Requirements, all Acceptance Criteria (ACs), and any predefined high-level Tasks.
- Keep a record of this original epic-defined scope for later deviation analysis.

### 3. Gather & Synthesize In-Depth Technical Context for Dev Agent

- <critical_rule>Systematically use the Index Doc (`docs/index.md`) as your primary guide to discover paths to ALL detailed documentation relevant to the current story's implementation needs.</critical_rule>
- Thoroughly review the PRD Doc, Main Arch Doc, and Frontend Arch Doc (if a UI story).
- Guided by the Index Doc and the story's needs, locate, analyze, and synthesize specific, relevant information from sources such as:
  - Data Models Doc (structure, validation rules).
  - API Reference Doc (endpoints, request/response schemas, auth).
  - Applicable architectural patterns or component designs from Arch Docs.
  - UI/UX Specs, Style Guides, Component Guides (for UI stories).
  - Specifics from Tech Stack Doc if versions or configurations are key for this story.
  - Relevant sections of the Operational Guidelines Doc (e.g., story-specific error handling nuances, security considerations for data handled in this story).
- The goal is to collect all necessary details the Dev Agent would need, to avoid them having to search extensively. Note any discrepancies between the epic and these details for "Deviation Analysis."

### 4. Verify Project Structure Alignment

- Cross-reference the story's requirements and anticipated file manipulations with the Project Structure Guide (and frontend structure if applicable).
- Ensure any file paths, component locations, or module names implied by the story align with defined structures.
- Document any structural conflicts, necessary clarifications, or undefined components/paths in a "Project Structure Notes" section within the story draft.

### 5. Populate Story Template with Full Context

- Create a new story file: `docs/stories/{epicNum}.{storyNum}.story.md`.
- Use the Story Template to structure the file.
- Fill in:
  - Story `{EpicNum}.{StoryNum}: {Short Title Copied from Epic File}`
  - `Status: Draft`
  - `Story` (User Story statement from Epic)
  - `Acceptance Criteria (ACs)` (from Epic, to be refined if needed based on context)
- **`Dev Technical Guidance` section (CRITICAL):**
  - Based on all context gathered (Step 3 & 4), embed concise but critical snippets of information, specific data structures, API endpoint details, precise references to _specific sections_ in other documents (e.g., "See `Data Models Doc#User-Schema-ValidationRules` for details"), or brief explanations of how architectural patterns apply to _this story_.
  - If UI story, provide specific references to Component/Style Guides relevant to _this story's elements_.
  - The aim is to make this section the Dev Agent's primary source for _story-specific_ technical context.
- **`Tasks / Subtasks` section:**
  - Generate a detailed, sequential list of technical tasks and subtasks the Dev Agent must perform to complete the story, informed by the gathered context.
  - Link tasks to ACs where applicable (e.g., `Task 1 (AC: 1, 3)`).
- Add notes on project structure alignment or discrepancies found in Step 4.
- Prepare content for the "Deviation Analysis" based on discrepancies noted in Step 3.

==================== START: tasks#index-docs ====================
# Index Documentation Task

## Purpose

This task maintains the integrity and completeness of the `docs/index.md` file by scanning all documentation files and ensuring they are properly indexed with descriptions. It handles both root-level documents and documents within subfolders, organizing them hierarchically.

## Task Instructions

You are now operating as a Documentation Indexer. Your goal is to ensure all documentation files are properly cataloged in the central index with proper organization for subfolders.

### Required Steps

1. First, locate and scan:

   - The `docs/` directory and all subdirectories
   - The existing `docs/index.md` file (create if absent)
   - All markdown (`.md`) and text (`.txt`) files in the documentation structure
   - Note the folder structure for hierarchical organization

2. For the existing `docs/index.md`:

   - Parse current entries
   - Note existing file references and descriptions
   - Identify any broken links or missing files
   - Keep track of already-indexed content
   - Preserve existing folder sections

3. For each documentation file found:

   - Extract the title (from first heading or filename)
   - Generate a brief description by analyzing the content
   - Create a relative markdown link to the file
   - Check if it's already in the index
   - Note which folder it belongs to (if in a subfolder)
   - If missing or outdated, prepare an update

4. For any missing or non-existent files found in index:

   - Present a list of all entries that reference non-existent files
   - For each entry:
     - Show the full entry details (title, path, description)
     - Ask for explicit confirmation before removal
     - Provide option to update the path if file was moved
     - Log the decision (remove/update/keep) for final report

5. Update `docs/index.md`:
   - Maintain existing structure and organization
   - Create level 2 sections (`##`) for each subfolder
   - List root-level documents first
   - Add missing entries with descriptions
   - Update outdated entries
   - Remove only entries that were confirmed for removal
   - Ensure consistent formatting throughout

### Index Structure Format

The index should be organized as follows:

```markdown
# Documentation Index

## Root Documents

### [Document Title](./document.md)

Brief description of the document's purpose and contents.

### [Another Document](./another.md)

Description here.

## Folder Name

Documents within the `folder-name/` directory:

### [Document in Folder](./folder-name/document.md)

Description of this document.

### [Another in Folder](./folder-name/another.md)

Description here.

## Another Folder

Documents within the `another-folder/` directory:

### [Nested Document](./another-folder/document.md)

Description of nested document.
```

### Index Entry Format

Each entry should follow this format:

```markdown
### [Document Title](relative/path/to/file.md)

Brief description of the document's purpose and contents.
```

### Rules of Operation

1. NEVER modify the content of indexed files
2. Preserve existing descriptions in index.md when they are adequate
3. Maintain any existing categorization or grouping in the index
4. Use relative paths for all links (starting with `./`)
5. Ensure descriptions are concise but informative
6. NEVER remove entries without explicit confirmation
7. Report any broken links or inconsistencies found
8. Allow path updates for moved files before considering removal
9. Create folder sections using level 2 headings (`##`)
10. Sort folders alphabetically, with root documents listed first
11. Within each section, sort documents alphabetically by title

### Process Output

The task will provide:

1. A summary of changes made to index.md
2. List of newly indexed files (organized by folder)
3. List of updated entries
4. List of entries presented for removal and their status:
   - Confirmed removals
   - Updated paths
   - Kept despite missing file
5. Any new folders discovered
6. Any other issues or inconsistencies found

### Handling Missing Files

For each file referenced in the index but not found in the filesystem:

1. Present the entry:

   ```markdown
   Missing file detected:
   Title: [Document Title]
   Path: relative/path/to/file.md
   Description: Existing description
   Section: [Root Documents | Folder Name]

   Options:

   1. Remove this entry
   2. Update the file path
   3. Keep entry (mark as temporarily unavailable)

   Please choose an option (1/2/3):
   ```

2. Wait for user confirmation before taking any action
3. Log the decision for the final report

### Special Cases

1. **Sharded Documents**: If a folder contains an `index.md` file, treat it as a sharded document:
   - Use the folder's `index.md` title as the section title
   - List the folder's documents as subsections
   - Note in the description that this is a multi-part document

2. **README files**: Convert `README.md` to more descriptive titles based on content

3. **Nested Subfolders**: For deeply nested folders, maintain the hierarchy but limit to 2 levels in the main index. Deeper structures should have their own index files.

## Required Input

Please provide:

1. Location of the `docs/` directory (default: `./docs`)
2. Confirmation of write access to `docs/index.md`
3. Any specific categorization preferences
4. Any files or directories to exclude from indexing (e.g., `.git`, `node_modules`)
5. Whether to include hidden files/folders (starting with `.`)

Would you like to proceed with documentation indexing? Please provide the required input above.

[[LLM: SM Agent populates relevant information, only what was pulled from actual artifacts from docs folder, relevant to this story. Do not invent information. If there were important notes from previous story that is relevant here, also include them here if it will help the dev agent. You do NOT need to repeat anything from coding standards or test standards as the dev agent is already aware of those. The dev agent should NEVER need to read the PRD or architecture documents though to complete this self contained story.]]

==================== END: templates#story-tmpl ====================

==================== START: checklists#story-draft-checklist ====================
# Story Draft Checklist

The Scrum Master should use this checklist to validate that each story contains sufficient context for a developer agent to implement it successfully, while assuming the dev agent has reasonable capabilities to figure things out.

[[LLM: INITIALIZATION INSTRUCTIONS - STORY DRAFT VALIDATION

Before proceeding with this checklist, ensure you have access to:

1. The story document being validated (usually in docs/stories/ or provided directly)
2. The parent epic context
3. Any referenced architecture or design documents
4. Previous related stories if this builds on prior work

IMPORTANT: This checklist validates individual stories BEFORE implementation begins.

VALIDATION PRINCIPLES:

1. Clarity - A developer should understand WHAT to build
2. Context - WHY this is being built and how it fits
3. Guidance - Key technical decisions and patterns to follow
4. Testability - How to verify the implementation works
5. Self-Contained - Most info needed is in the story itself

REMEMBER: We assume competent developer agents who can:

- Research documentation and codebases
- Make reasonable technical decisions
- Follow established patterns
- Ask for clarification when truly stuck

We're checking for SUFFICIENT guidance, not exhaustive detail.]]

## 1. GOAL & CONTEXT CLARITY

[[LLM: Without clear goals, developers build the wrong thing. Verify:

1. The story states WHAT functionality to implement
2. The business value or user benefit is clear
3. How this fits into the larger epic/product is explained
4. Dependencies are explicit ("requires Story X to be complete")
5. Success looks like something specific, not vague]]

- [ ] Story goal/purpose is clearly stated
- [ ] Relationship to epic goals is evident
- [ ] How the story fits into overall system flow is explained
- [ ] Dependencies on previous stories are identified (if applicable)
- [ ] Business context and value are clear

## 2. TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE

[[LLM: Developers need enough technical context to start coding. Check:

1. Key files/components to create or modify are mentioned
2. Technology choices are specified where non-obvious
3. Integration points with existing code are identified
4. Data models or API contracts are defined or referenced
5. Non-standard patterns or exceptions are called out

Note: We don't need every file listed - just the important ones.]]

- [ ] Key files to create/modify are identified (not necessarily exhaustive)
- [ ] Technologies specifically needed for this story are mentioned
- [ ] Critical APIs or interfaces are sufficiently described
- [ ] Necessary data models or structures are referenced
- [ ] Required environment variables are listed (if applicable)
- [ ] Any exceptions to standard coding patterns are noted

## 3. REFERENCE EFFECTIVENESS

[[LLM: References should help, not create a treasure hunt. Ensure:

1. References point to specific sections, not whole documents
2. The relevance of each reference is explained
3. Critical information is summarized in the story
4. References are accessible (not broken links)
5. Previous story context is summarized if needed]]

- [ ] References to external documents point to specific relevant sections
- [ ] Critical information from previous stories is summarized (not just referenced)
- [ ] Context is provided for why references are relevant
- [ ] References use consistent format (e.g., `docs/filename.md#section`)

## 4. SELF-CONTAINMENT ASSESSMENT

[[LLM: Stories should be mostly self-contained to avoid context switching. Verify:

1. Core requirements are in the story, not just in references
2. Domain terms are explained or obvious from context
3. Assumptions are stated explicitly
4. Edge cases are mentioned (even if deferred)
5. The story could be understood without reading 10 other documents]]

- [ ] Core information needed is included (not overly reliant on external docs)
- [ ] Implicit assumptions are made explicit
- [ ] Domain-specific terms or concepts are explained
- [ ] Edge cases or error scenarios are addressed

## 5. TESTING GUIDANCE

[[LLM: Testing ensures the implementation actually works. Check:

1. Test approach is specified (unit, integration, e2e)
2. Key test scenarios are listed
3. Success criteria are measurable
4. Special test considerations are noted
5. Acceptance criteria in the story are testable]]

- [ ] Required testing approach is outlined
- [ ] Key test scenarios are identified
- [ ] Success criteria are defined
- [ ] Special testing considerations are noted (if applicable)

## VALIDATION RESULT

[[LLM: FINAL STORY VALIDATION REPORT

Generate a concise validation report:

1. Quick Summary

   - Story readiness: READY / NEEDS REVISION / BLOCKED
   - Clarity score (1-10)
   - Major gaps identified

2. Fill in the validation table with:

   - PASS: Requirements clearly met
   - PARTIAL: Some gaps but workable
   - FAIL: Critical information missing

3. Specific Issues (if any)

   - List concrete problems to fix
   - Suggest specific improvements
   - Identify any blocking dependencies

4. Developer Perspective
   - Could YOU implement this story as written?
   - What questions would you have?
   - What might cause delays or rework?

Be pragmatic - perfect documentation doesn't exist. Focus on whether a competent developer can succeed with this story.]]

# Template Format Conventions

Templates in the BMAD method use standardized markup for AI processing. These conventions ensure consistent document generation.

## Template Markup Elements

- **{{placeholders}}**: Variables to be replaced with actual content
- **[[LLM: instructions]]**: Internal processing instructions for AI agents (never shown to users)
- **<<REPEAT>>** sections: Content blocks that may be repeated as needed
- **^^CONDITION^^** blocks: Conditional content included only if criteria are met
- **@{examples}**: Example content for guidance (never output to users)

## Processing Rules

- Replace all {{placeholders}} with project-specific content
- Execute all [[LLM: instructions]] internally without showing users
- Process conditional and repeat blocks as specified
- Use examples for guidance but never include them in final output
- Present only clean, formatted content to users

## Critical Guidelines

- **NEVER display template markup, LLM instructions, or examples to users**
- Template elements are for AI processing only
- Focus on faithful template execution and clean output
- All template-specific instructions are embedded within templates
