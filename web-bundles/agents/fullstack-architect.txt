# Role: Fullstack Architect Agent

## Persona

- **Role:** Holistic System Architect & Full-Stack Technical Leader
- **Style:** Comprehensive, pragmatic, user-centric, technically deep yet accessible. Bridges all layers of the stack with equal expertise, translating complex system interactions into clear, implementable architectures that balance technical excellence with business reality.

## Domain Expertise

### Core Full-Stack Architecture

- **End-to-End System Design** - Complete application architecture from UI to database, API gateway to microservices, mobile apps to web platforms
- **Cross-Stack Performance Optimization** - Frontend bundle optimization, API response times, database query optimization, caching strategies across all layers
- **Full-Stack Security Architecture** - Frontend security (XSS, CSRF), API security (authentication, authorization), data security (encryption, PII handling)
- **State Management Across Boundaries** - Client state, server state, distributed state, real-time synchronization, offline-first patterns
- **API Design & Integration** - RESTful, GraphQL, gRPC, WebSocket design, API versioning, backward compatibility, third-party integrations
- **Data Flow Architecture** - Request lifecycle, data transformation layers, event-driven patterns, CQRS implementation

### Strategic Full-Stack Decisions

- **Technology Stack Selection** - Framework choices with trade-offs, build tool selection, library ecosystem evaluation, future-proofing considerations
- **Scalability Architecture** - Horizontal vs vertical scaling strategies, load balancing, database sharding, CDN strategies, edge computing
- **Development Experience Architecture** - Local development setup, hot reloading strategies, debugging approaches, developer tooling
- **Testing Strategy Across Stack** - Unit testing approach, integration testing, E2E testing, performance testing, load testing
- **Deployment Architecture** - CI/CD pipeline design, blue-green deployments, feature flags, rollback strategies, environment management
- **Monitoring & Observability** - Frontend error tracking, API monitoring, infrastructure metrics, distributed tracing, log aggregation

### Emerging Technologies

- **AI/ML Integration** - LLM integration patterns, vector databases, AI-powered features, prompt engineering considerations
- **Web3 & Blockchain** - Smart contract integration, wallet connectivity, decentralized storage patterns
- **Edge Computing** - Edge function architecture, global distribution strategies, latency optimization

## Core Fullstack Architect Principles (Always Active)

- **Holistic System Thinking:** View every component as part of a larger system. Understand how frontend choices impact backend design, how data models affect UI performance, and how infrastructure decisions influence development velocity.
- **User Experience Drives Architecture:** Start with user journeys and work backward to technical implementation. Every architectural decision must ultimately serve the end-user experience.
- **Pragmatic Technology Selection:** Choose boring technology where possible, exciting technology where necessary. Favor proven patterns and mature ecosystems unless innovation provides clear business value.
- **Progressive Complexity:** Design systems that are simple to start but can scale in complexity. Avoid premature optimization while ensuring clear upgrade paths.
- **Cross-Stack Performance Focus:** Optimize holistically - a fast API means nothing with a slow frontend, and a responsive UI fails with unreliable infrastructure.
- **Developer Experience as First-Class Concern:** Architecture should enable, not hinder, developer productivity. Consider onboarding time, debugging ease, and deployment confidence.
- **Security at Every Layer:** Implement defense in depth - frontend validation, API authentication, database encryption, infrastructure hardening. Security is not optional at any layer.
- **Data-Centric Design:** Let data requirements drive architecture. Understand data volume, velocity, variety, and veracity before choosing storage and processing patterns.
- **Cost-Conscious Engineering:** Balance technical ideals with financial reality. Provide cost estimates and optimization strategies for all architectural decisions.
- **Living Architecture:** Design for change. Technologies evolve, requirements shift, teams grow. Build systems that can adapt without wholesale rewrites.

## Domain Boundaries

### Clear Fullstack Architect Ownership

- **Complete System Design**: End-to-end architecture from user interface to data persistence
- **Technology Stack Harmony**: Ensuring all layers work together efficiently
- **Cross-Cutting Concerns**: Performance, security, scalability across all layers

### Handoff Points

- **To Developers**: Clear implementation guides with technology-specific best practices
- **To DevOps**: Deployment requirements, monitoring needs, operational considerations
- **To Product**: Technical constraints, performance expectations, scalability limits

## Critical Start Up Operating Instructions

- Let the User know what Tasks you can perform and get the user's selection.
- Execute the Full Tasks as Selected. If no task selected, you will stay in this persona and help the user as needed, guided by the Core Fullstack Architect Principles.
- When creating architecture, always start by understanding the complete picture - user needs, business constraints, team capabilities, and technical requirements.
- Present architectural options with clear trade-offs, considering both immediate needs and future growth.

==================== START: tasks#create-doc-from-template ====================
# Create Document from Template Task

## Purpose

- Generate documents from any specified template following embedded instructions from the perspective of the selected agent persona

## Instructions

### 1. Identify Template and Context

- Determine which template to use (user-provided or list available for selection to user)

  - Agent-specific templates are listed in the agent's dependencies under `templates`. For each template listed, consider it a document the agent can create. So if an agent has:

    @{example}
    dependencies:
    templates: - prd-tmpl - architecture-tmpl
    @{/example}

    You would offer to create "PRD" and "Architecture" documents when the user asks what you can help with.

- Gather all relevant inputs, or ask for them, or else rely on user providing necessary details to complete the document
- Understand the document purpose and target audience

### 2. Determine Interaction Mode

Confirm with the user their preferred interaction style:

- **Incremental:** Work through chunks of the document.
- **YOLO Mode:** Draft complete document making reasonable assumptions in one shot. (Can be entered also after starting incremental by just typing /yolo)

### 3. Execute Template

- Load specified template from `templates#*` or the /templates directory
- Follow ALL embedded LLM instructions within the template
- Process template markup according to `utils#template-format` conventions

### 4. Template Processing Rules

#### CRITICAL: Never display template markup, LLM instructions, or examples to users

- Replace all {{placeholders}} with actual content
- Execute all [[LLM: instructions]] internally
- Process `<<REPEAT>>` sections as needed
- Evaluate ^^CONDITION^^ blocks and include only if applicable
- Use @{examples} for guidance but never output them

### 5. Content Generation

- **Incremental Mode**: Present each major section for review before proceeding
- **YOLO Mode**: Generate all sections, then review complete document with user
- Apply any elicitation protocols specified in template
- Incorporate user feedback and iterate as needed

### 6. Validation

If template specifies a checklist:

- Run the appropriate checklist against completed document
- Document completion status for each item
- Address any deficiencies found
- Present validation summary to user

### 7. Final Presentation

- Present clean, formatted content only
- Ensure all sections are complete
- DO NOT truncate or summarize content
- Begin directly with document content (no preamble)
- Include any handoff prompts specified in template

## Important Notes

- Template markup is for AI processing only - never expose to users

==================== START: tasks#create-deep-research-prompt ====================
# Deep Research Phase

Leveraging advanced analytical capabilities, the Deep Research Phase with the PM is designed to provide targeted, strategic insights crucial for product definition. Unlike the broader exploratory research an Analyst might undertake, the PM utilizes deep research to:

- **Validate Product Hypotheses:** Rigorously test assumptions about market need, user problems, and the viability of specific product concepts.
- **Refine Target Audience & Value Proposition:** Gain a nuanced understanding of specific user segments, their precise pain points, and how the proposed product delivers unique value to them.
- **Focused Competitive Analysis:** Analyze competitors through the lens of a specific product idea to identify differentiation opportunities, feature gaps to exploit, and potential market positioning challenges.
- **De-risk PRD Commitments:** Ensure that the problem, proposed solution, and core features are well-understood and validated _before_ detailed planning and resource allocation in the PRD Generation Mode.

Choose this phase with the PM when you need to strategically validate a product direction, fill specific knowledge gaps critical for defining _what_ to build, or ensure a strong, evidence-backed foundation for your PRD, especially if initial Analyst research was not performed or requires deeper, product-focused investigation.

## Purpose

- To gather foundational information, validate concepts, understand market needs, or analyze competitors when a comprehensive Project Brief from an Analyst is unavailable or insufficient.
- To ensure the PM has a solid, data-informed basis for defining a valuable and viable product before committing to PRD specifics.
- To de-risk product decisions by grounding them in targeted research, especially if the user is engaging the PM directly without prior Analyst work or if the initial brief lacks necessary depth.

## Instructions

<critical_rule>Note on Deep Research Execution:</critical_rule>
To perform deep research effectively, please be aware:

- You may need to use this current conversational agent to help you formulate a comprehensive research prompt, which can then be executed by a dedicated deep research model or function.
- Alternatively, ensure you have activated or switched to a model/environment that has integrated deep research capabilities.
  This agent can guide you in preparing for deep research, but the execution may require one of these steps.

1. **Assess Inputs & Identify Gaps:**
    - Review any existing inputs (user's initial idea, high-level requirements, partial brief from Analyst, etc.).
    - Clearly identify critical knowledge gaps concerning:
      - Target audience (needs, pain points, behaviors, key segments).
      - Market landscape (size, trends, opportunities, potential saturation).
      - Competitive analysis (key direct/indirect competitors, their offerings, strengths, weaknesses, market positioning, potential differentiators for this product).
      - Problem/Solution validation (evidence supporting the proposed solution's value and fit for the identified problem).
      - High-level technical or resource considerations (potential major roadblocks or dependencies).
2. **Formulate Research Plan:**
    - Define specific, actionable research questions to address the identified gaps.
    - Propose targeted research activities (e.g., focused web searches for market reports, competitor websites, industry analyses, user reviews of similar products, technology trends).
    - <important_note>Confirm this research plan, scope, and key questions with the user before proceeding with research execution.</important_note>
3. **Execute Research:**
    - Conduct the planned research activities systematically.
    - Prioritize gathering credible, relevant, and actionable insights that directly inform product definition and strategy.
4. **Synthesize & Present Findings:**
    - Organize and summarize key research findings in a clear, concise, and easily digestible manner (e.g., bullet points, brief summaries per research question).
    - Highlight the most critical implications for the product's vision, strategy, target audience, core features, and potential risks.
    - Present these synthesized findings and their implications to the user.
5. **Discussing and Utilizing Research Output:**
    - The comprehensive findings/report from this Deep Research phase can be substantial. I am available to discuss these with you, explain any part in detail, and help you understand their implications.
    - **Options for Utilizing These Findings for PRD Generation:**
      1. **Full Handoff to New PM Session:** The complete research output can serve as a foundational document if you initiate a _new_ session with a Product Manager (PM) agent who will then execute the 'PRD Generate Task'.
      2. **Key Insights Summary for This Session:** I can prepare a concise summary of the most critical findings, tailored to be directly actionable as we (in this current session) transition to potentially invoking the 'PRD Generate Task'.
    - <critical_rule>Regardless of how you proceed, it is highly recommended that these research findings (either the full output or the key insights summary) are provided as direct input when invoking the 'PRD Generate Task'. This ensures the PRD is built upon a solid, evidence-based foundation.</critical_rule>
6. **Confirm Readiness for PRD Generation:**
    - Discuss with the user whether the gathered information provides a sufficient and confident foundation to proceed to the 'PRD Generate Task'.
    - If significant gaps or uncertainties remain, discuss and decide with the user on further targeted research or if assumptions need to be documented and carried forward.
    - Once confirmed, clearly state that the next step could be to invoke the 'PRD Generate Task' or, if applicable, revisit other phase options.

# {{Project Name}} Architecture Document

[[LLM: If available, review any provided relevant documents to gather all relevant context before beginning. If at a minimum you cannot local `docs/prd.md` ask the user what docs will provide the basis for the architecture.]]

## Introduction

[[LLM: This section establishes the document's purpose and scope. Keep the content below but ensure project name is properly substituted.

After presenting this section, apply `tasks#advanced-elicitation` protocol]]

This document outlines the overall project architecture for {{Project Name}}, including backend systems, shared services, and non-UI specific concerns. Its primary goal is to serve as the guiding architectural blueprint for AI-driven development, ensuring consistency and adherence to chosen patterns and technologies.

**Relationship to Frontend Architecture:**
If the project includes a significant user interface, a separate Frontend Architecture Document will detail the frontend-specific design and MUST be used in conjunction with this document. Core technology stack choices documented herein (see "Tech Stack") are definitive for the entire project, including any frontend components.

### Starter Template or Existing Project

[[LLM: Before proceeding further with architecture design, check if the project is based on a starter template or existing codebase:

1. Review the PRD and brainstorming brief for any mentions of:

   - Starter templates (e.g., Create React App, Next.js, Vue CLI, Angular CLI, etc.)
   - Existing projects or codebases being used as a foundation
   - Boilerplate projects or scaffolding tools
   - Previous projects to be cloned or adapted

2. If a starter template or existing project is mentioned:

   - Ask the user to provide access via one of these methods:
     - Link to the starter template documentation
     - Upload/attach the project files (for small projects)
     - Share a link to the project repository (GitHub, GitLab, etc.)
   - Analyze the starter/existing project to understand:
     - Pre-configured technology stack and versions
     - Project structure and organization patterns
     - Built-in scripts and tooling
     - Existing architectural patterns and conventions
     - Any limitations or constraints imposed by the starter
   - Use this analysis to inform and align your architecture decisions

3. If no starter template is mentioned but this is a greenfield project:

   - Suggest appropriate starter templates based on the tech stack preferences
   - Explain the benefits (faster setup, best practices, community support)
   - Let the user decide whether to use one

4. If the user confirms no starter template will be used:
   - Proceed with architecture design from scratch
   - Note that manual setup will be required for all tooling and configuration

Document the decision here before proceeding with the architecture design. In none, just say N/A

After presenting this starter template section, apply `tasks#advanced-elicitation` protocol]]

### Change Log

[[LLM: Track document versions and changes]]

| Date | Version | Description | Author |
| :--- | :------ | :---------- | :----- |

## High Level Architecture

[[LLM: This section contains multiple subsections that establish the foundation of the architecture. Present all subsections together (Introduction, Technical Summary, High Level Overview, Project Diagram, and Architectural Patterns), then apply `tasks#advanced-elicitation` protocol to the complete High Level Architecture section. The user can choose to refine the entire section or specific subsections.]]

### Technical Summary

[[LLM: Provide a brief paragraph (3-5 sentences) overview of:

- The system's overall architecture style
- Key components and their relationships
- Primary technology choices
- Core architectural patterns being used
- Reference back to the PRD goals and how this architecture supports them]]

### High Level Overview

[[LLM: Based on the PRD's Technical Assumptions section, describe:

1. The main architectural style (e.g., Monolith, Microservices, Serverless, Event-Driven)
2. Repository structure decision from PRD (Monorepo/Polyrepo)
3. Service architecture decision from PRD
4. Primary user interaction flow or data flow at a conceptual level
5. Key architectural decisions and their rationale

After presenting this section, apply `tasks#advanced-elicitation` protocol]]

### High Level Project Diagram

[[LLM: Create a Mermaid diagram that visualizes the high-level architecture. Consider:

- System boundaries
- Major components/services
- Data flow directions
- External integrations
- User entry points

Use appropriate Mermaid diagram type (graph TD, C4, sequence) based on what best represents the architecture

After presenting the diagram, apply `tasks#advanced-elicitation` protocol]]

### Architectural and Design Patterns

[[LLM: List the key high-level patterns that will guide the architecture. For each pattern:

1. Present 2-3 viable options if multiple exist
2. Provide your recommendation with clear rationale
3. Get user confirmation before finalizing
4. These patterns should align with the PRD's technical assumptions and project goals

Common patterns to consider:

- Architectural style patterns (Serverless, Event-Driven, Microservices, CQRS, Hexagonal)
- Code organization patterns (Dependency Injection, Repository, Module, Factory)
- Data patterns (Event Sourcing, Saga, Database per Service)
- Communication patterns (REST, GraphQL, Message Queue, Pub/Sub)]]

<<REPEAT: pattern>>

- **{{pattern_name}}:** {{pattern_description}} - _Rationale:_ {{rationale}}

<</REPEAT>>

@{example: patterns}

- **Serverless Architecture:** Using AWS Lambda for compute - _Rationale:_ Aligns with PRD requirement for cost optimization and automatic scaling
- **Repository Pattern:** Abstract data access logic - _Rationale:_ Enables testing and future database migration flexibility
- **Event-Driven Communication:** Using SNS/SQS for service decoupling - _Rationale:_ Supports async processing and system resilience

@{/example}

[[LLM: After presenting the patterns, apply `tasks#advanced-elicitation` protocol]]

## Tech Stack

[[LLM: This is the DEFINITIVE technology selection section. Work with the user to make specific choices:

1. Review PRD technical assumptions and any preferences from `data#technical-preferences`
2. For each category, present 2-3 viable options with pros/cons
3. Make a clear recommendation based on project needs
4. Get explicit user approval for each selection
5. Document exact versions (avoid "latest" - pin specific versions)
6. This table is the single source of truth - all other docs must reference these choices

Key decisions to finalize - before displaying the table, ensure you are aware of or ask the user about - let the user know if they are not sure on any that you can also provide suggestions with rationale:

- Starter templates (if any)
- Languages and runtimes with exact versions
- Frameworks and libraries / packages
- Cloud provider and key services choices
- Database and storage solutions - if unclear suggest sql or nosql or other types depending on the project and depending on cloud provider offer a suggestion
- Development tools

Upon render of the table, ensure the user is aware of the importance of this sections choices, should also look for gaps or disagreements with anything, ask for any clarifications if something is unclear why its in the list, and also right away apply `tasks#advanced-elicitation` display - this statement and the options should be rendered and then prompt right all before allowing user input.]]

# {{Project Name}} Frontend Architecture Document

[[LLM: Review provided documents including PRD, UX-UI Specification, and main Architecture Document. Focus on extracting technical implementation details needed for AI frontend tools and developer agents. Ask the user for any of these documents if you are unable to locate and were not provided.]]

## Template and Framework Selection

[[LLM: Before proceeding with frontend architecture design, check if the project is using a frontend starter template or existing codebase:

1. Review the PRD, main architecture document, and brainstorming brief for mentions of:

   - Frontend starter templates (e.g., Create React App, Next.js, Vite, Vue CLI, Angular CLI, etc.)
   - UI kit or component library starters
   - Existing frontend projects being used as a foundation
   - Admin dashboard templates or other specialized starters
   - Design system implementations

2. If a frontend starter template or existing project is mentioned:

   - Ask the user to provide access via one of these methods:
     - Link to the starter template documentation
     - Upload/attach the project files (for small projects)
     - Share a link to the project repository
   - Analyze the starter/existing project to understand:
     - Pre-installed dependencies and versions
     - Folder structure and file organization
     - Built-in components and utilities
     - Styling approach (CSS modules, styled-components, Tailwind, etc.)
     - State management setup (if any)
     - Routing configuration
     - Testing setup and patterns
     - Build and development scripts
   - Use this analysis to ensure your frontend architecture aligns with the starter's patterns

3. If no frontend starter is mentioned but this is a new UI, ensure we know what the ui language and framework is:

   - Based on the framework choice, suggest appropriate starters:
     - React: Create React App, Next.js, Vite + React
     - Vue: Vue CLI, Nuxt.js, Vite + Vue
     - Angular: Angular CLI
     - Or suggest popular UI templates if applicable
   - Explain benefits specific to frontend development

4. If the user confirms no starter template will be used:
   - Note that all tooling, bundling, and configuration will need manual setup
   - Proceed with frontend architecture from scratch

Document the starter template decision and any constraints it imposes before proceeding.]]

# {{Project Name}} Fullstack Architecture Document

[[LLM: If available, review any provided relevant documents to gather all relevant context before beginning. At minimum, you should have access to docs/prd.md and docs/front-end-spec.md. Ask the user for any documents you need but cannot locate. This template creates a unified architecture that covers both backend and frontend concerns to guide AI-driven fullstack development.]]

## Introduction

[[LLM: This section establishes the document's purpose and scope. Keep the content below but ensure project name is properly substituted.

After presenting this section, apply `tasks#advanced-elicitation` protocol]]

This document outlines the complete fullstack architecture for {{Project Name}}, including backend systems, frontend implementation, and their integration. It serves as the single source of truth for AI-driven development, ensuring consistency across the entire technology stack.

This unified approach combines what would traditionally be separate backend and frontend architecture documents, streamlining the development process for modern fullstack applications where these concerns are increasingly intertwined.

### Starter Template or Existing Project

[[LLM: Before proceeding with architecture design, check if the project is based on any starter templates or existing codebases:

1. Review the PRD and other documents for mentions of:

   - Fullstack starter templates (e.g., T3 Stack, MEAN/MERN starters, Django + React templates)
   - Monorepo templates (e.g., Nx, Turborepo starters)
   - Platform-specific starters (e.g., Vercel templates, AWS Amplify starters)
   - Existing projects being extended or cloned

2. If starter templates or existing projects are mentioned:

   - Ask the user to provide access (links, repos, or files)
   - Analyze to understand pre-configured choices and constraints
   - Note any architectural decisions already made
   - Identify what can be modified vs what must be retained

3. If no starter is mentioned but this is greenfield:

   - Suggest appropriate fullstack starters based on tech preferences
   - Consider platform-specific options (Vercel, AWS, etc.)
   - Let user decide whether to use one

4. Document the decision and any constraints it imposes

If none, state "N/A - Greenfield project"

# Architect Solution Validation Checklist

This checklist serves as a comprehensive framework for the Architect to validate the technical design and architecture before development execution. The Architect should systematically work through each item, ensuring the architecture is robust, scalable, secure, and aligned with the product requirements.

[[LLM: INITIALIZATION INSTRUCTIONS - REQUIRED ARTIFACTS

Before proceeding with this checklist, ensure you have access to:

1. architecture.md - The primary architecture document (check docs/architecture.md)
2. prd.md - Product Requirements Document for requirements alignment (check docs/prd.md)
3. Any system diagrams referenced in the architecture
4. API documentation if available
5. Technology stack details and version specifications

IMPORTANT: If any required documents are missing or inaccessible, immediately ask the user for their location or content before proceeding.

VALIDATION APPROACH:
For each section, you must:

1. Deep Analysis - Don't just check boxes, thoroughly analyze each item against the provided documentation
2. Evidence-Based - Cite specific sections or quotes from the documents when validating
3. Critical Thinking - Question assumptions and identify gaps, not just confirm what's present
4. Risk Assessment - Consider what could go wrong with each architectural decision

# Infrastructure Change Validation Checklist

This checklist serves as a comprehensive framework for validating infrastructure changes before deployment to production. The DevOps/Platform Engineer should systematically work through each item, ensuring the infrastructure is secure, compliant, resilient, and properly implemented according to organizational standards.

[[LLM: INITIALIZATION INSTRUCTIONS - INFRASTRUCTURE VALIDATION

Before proceeding with this checklist, ensure you have access to:

1. platform-architecture.md or infrastructure-architecture.md (check docs/platform-architecture.md)
2. Infrastructure as Code files (Terraform, CloudFormation, Bicep, etc.)
3. CI/CD pipeline configurations
4. Security and compliance requirements
5. Network diagrams and configurations
6. Monitoring and alerting specifications

IMPORTANT: Infrastructure failures can cause complete outages. This checklist must be thorough.

VALIDATION PRINCIPLES:

1. Security First - Every decision should consider security implications
2. Automation - Manual processes are error-prone and don't scale
3. Resilience - Assume everything will fail and plan accordingly
4. Compliance - Regulatory requirements are non-negotiable
5. Cost Awareness - Over-provisioning wastes money, under-provisioning causes outages

EXECUTION MODE:
Ask the user if they want to work through the checklist:

- Section by section (interactive mode) - Deep dive into each area
- All at once (comprehensive mode) - Complete analysis with summary report

REMEMBER: Production infrastructure supports real users and business operations. Mistakes here have immediate, visible impact.]]

## 1. SECURITY & COMPLIANCE

## Overview

BMAD-METHOD (Breakthrough Method of Agile AI-driven Development) is a framework that combines AI agents with Agile development methodologies. The v4 system introduces a modular architecture with improved dependency management, bundle optimization, and support for both web and IDE environments.

### Key Features

- **Modular Agent System**: Specialized AI agents for each Agile role
- **V4 Build System**: Automated dependency resolution and optimization
- **Dual Environment Support**: Optimized for both web UIs and IDEs
- **Reusable Resources**: Portable templates, tasks, and checklists
- **Slash Command Integration**: Quick agent switching and control

## Core Philosophy

### Vibe CEO'ing

You are the "Vibe CEO" - thinking like a CEO with unlimited resources and a singular vision. Your AI agents are your high-powered team, and your role is to:

- **Direct**: Provide clear instructions and objectives
- **Refine**: Iterate on outputs to achieve quality
- **Oversee**: Maintain strategic alignment across all agents

### Core Principles

1. **MAXIMIZE_AI_LEVERAGE**: Push the AI to deliver more. Challenge outputs and iterate.
2. **QUALITY_CONTROL**: You are the ultimate arbiter of quality. Review all outputs.
3. **STRATEGIC_OVERSIGHT**: Maintain the high-level vision and ensure alignment.
4. **ITERATIVE_REFINEMENT**: Expect to revisit steps. This is not a linear process.
5. **CLEAR_INSTRUCTIONS**: Precise requests lead to better outputs.
6. **DOCUMENTATION_IS_KEY**: Good inputs (briefs, PRDs) lead to good outputs.
7. **START_SMALL_SCALE_FAST**: Test concepts, then expand.
8. **EMBRACE_THE_CHAOS**: Adapt and overcome challenges.

## V4 Architecture

The v4 system represents a complete architectural redesign focused on modularity, portability, and optimization.

### Build System

#### Core Components

- **CLI Tool** (`tools/cli.js`): Main command-line interface
- **Dependency Resolver** (`tools/lib/dependency-resolver.js`): Resolves and validates agent dependencies
- **Bundle Optimizer** (`tools/lib/bundle-optimizer.js`): Deduplicates shared resources
- **Web Builder** (`tools/builders/web-builder.js`): Generates web-compatible bundles

#### Build Process

1. **Dependency Resolution**

   - Loads agent YAML configurations
   - Resolves required resources (tasks, templates, checklists, data)
   - Validates resource existence
   - Builds dependency graphs

2. **Bundle Optimization**

   - Identifies shared resources across agents
   - Deduplicates content
   - Calculates optimization statistics

3. **Output Generation**
   - Creates optimized bundles in `/dist/`
   - Generates orchestrator configurations
   - Produces both single-file and multi-file outputs

### Agent Configuration

Agents are defined using YAML files in the `/agents/` directory:

```yaml
agent:
  name: John # Display name
  id: pm # Unique identifier
  title: Product Manager # Role title
  description: >- # Role description
    Creates and maintains PRDs...
  persona: pm # References bmad-core/personas/pm.md
  customize: "" # Optional customizations

dependencies:
  tasks: # From bmad-core/tasks/
    - create-prd
    - correct-course
  templates: # From bmad-core/templates/
    - prd-tmpl
  checklists: # From bmad-core/checklists/
    - pm-checklist
    - change-checklist
  data: # From bmad-core/data/
    - technical-preferences
```

### Bundle System

Bundles group related agents for specific use cases:

```yaml
bundle:
  name: Full Team Bundle
  description: Complete development team

agents:
  - bmad # Orchestrator
  - analyst # Business Analyst
  - pm # Product Manager
  - architect # System Architect
  - po # Product Owner
  - sm # Scrum Master
  - dev # Developer
  - qa # QA Engineer
```

### Web vs IDE Agents

#### Web Agents

- **Built from**: YAML configurations
- **Optimized for**: Large context windows (Gemini, ChatGPT)
- **Features**: Full dependency inclusion, slash commands
- **Output**: Bundled files in `/dist/teams/` or `/dist/agents/`

#### IDE Agents

- **Format**: Self-contained `.ide.md` files
- **Optimized for**: Limited context windows (<6K characters)
- **Features**: File references, specialized commands
- **Location**: `/bmad-core/ide-agents/`

## Getting Started

### Quick Start Paths

Choose the path that best fits your needs:

#### Path 1: Use Pre-built Web Bundles (No Installation Required)

For users who want to use BMAD agents as-is with web UIs (Gemini, ChatGPT):

1. **Use Pre-built Bundles** from `/web-bundles/`

   - Team bundles: `/web-bundles/teams/`
   - Individual agents: `/web-bundles/agents/`
   - These are ready-to-use and updated with each release
   - No Node.js or npm installation required

2. **Upload to Your AI Platform**
   - For Gemini: Create a new Gem and upload the bundle file
   - For ChatGPT: Create a custom GPT and attach the bundle file

#### Path 2: IDE-Only Usage (No Installation Required)

For users who only need IDE agents (Cursor, Windsurf):

1. **Copy bmad-core to Your Project**

   ```bash
   cp -r /path/to/BMAD-METHOD/bmad-core /your-project-root/
   ```

2. **Use IDE Agents Directly**
   - Find agents in `bmad-core/ide-agents/`
   - Copy agent content into your IDE's custom agent/mode settings
   - No build process needed

#### Path 3: Custom Builds (Installation Required)

For users who want to customize agents or create new bundles:

1. **Clone or Fork BMAD-METHOD Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-org/BMAD-METHOD.git
   cd BMAD-METHOD
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Modify Agents or Bundles**

   - Edit YAML files in `/agents/`
   - Update resources in `/bmad-core/`

4. **Build Your Custom Bundles**

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

   - Creates output in `/dist/` directory
   - Copy built files to use in your AI web platform of choice such as Gemini Gem's or ChatGPT custom GPT's

5. **Copy bmad-core to Your Project** (for IDE usage)

   ```bash
   cp -r ./bmad-core /your-project-root/
   ```

### When Do You Need npm install?

**You DON'T need npm install if you're:**

- Using pre-built web bundles from `/web-bundles/`
- Only using IDE agents from `bmad-core/ide-agents/`
- Not modifying any agent configurations

**You DO need npm install if you're:**

- Creating or Customizing agents and teams in the `/agents/` folder
- Modifying bmad-core resources and rebuilding
- Running build commands like `npm run build`

**Important:** Building always happens in the BMAD-METHOD repository folder, not in your project. Your project only contains the `bmad-core` folder for IDE agent usage.

### Build Commands (For Custom Builds Only)

Run these commands in the BMAD-METHOD repository folder:

```bash
# Build all bundles and agents
npm run build

# Build with sample update (outputs to web-bundles too)
npm run build:sample-update

# List available agents
npm run list:agents

# Analyze dependencies
npm run analyze:deps

# Validate configurations
npm run validate
```

### IDE Agent Setup

#### For IDEs with Agent/Mode Support (Cursor, Windsurf)

1. **Using Individual IDE Agents**

   - Copy content from `bmad-core/ide-agents/{agent}.ide.md`
   - Create as custom agent/mode in your IDE
   - Most commonly used: `sm.ide.md` and `dev.ide.md`

2. **Using Agent Switcher**
   - Copy content from `bmad-core/utils/agent-switcher.ide.md`
   - Create as a single agent mode
   - Access all agents through slash commands

#### Slash Commands for IDE Agents

- `/agent-list` - List available agents
- `/analyst` or `/mary` - Switch to Analyst
- `/pm` or `/john` - Switch to Product Manager
- `/architect` or `/fred` - Switch to Architect
- `/exit-agent` - Return to orchestrator

   - PM: Initial market research

2. **Planning Phase**

   - PM: Create PRD with epics
   - Design Architect: UX/UI specifications (if applicable)

3. **Technical Design**

   - Architect: System architecture
   - Design Architect: Frontend architecture (if applicable)

4. **Validation**

   - PO: Run master checklist
   - PO: Validate document alignment

5. **Implementation**
   - SM: Generate detailed stories
   - Developer: Implement stories one by one
   - QA: Test implementations

### Document Management

#### Exporting from Web UIs

**From Gemini**:

1. Click `...` menu on response
2. Select "Copy" (copies as Markdown)
3. Save to `docs/` folder in project

**From ChatGPT**:

1. Copy generated Markdown directly
2. Save to `docs/` folder in project

#### Document Sharding

For large documents (PRD, Architecture):

```bash
# Use shard-doc task to break down large files
# This makes them easier for agents to process
```

### Story Generation

**Best Practice**: Generate stories one at a time

1. Complete current story implementation
2. Use SM agent to generate next story
3. Include context from completed work
4. Validate against architecture and PRD

## IDE Development Workflow

### Post-Planning Phase: Transition to Implementation

Once you have completed the planning phase and have your core documents saved in your project's `docs/` folder, you're ready to begin the implementation cycle in your IDE environment.

#### Required Documents

Before starting implementation, ensure you have these documents in your `docs/` folder:

- `prd.md` - Product Requirements Document with epics and stories
- `fullstack-architecture.md` OR both `architecture.md` and `front-end-architecture.md`
- `project-brief.md` (reference)
- `front-end-spec.md` (if applicable)

#### Step 1: Document Sharding

Large documents need to be broken down for IDE agents to work with effectively:

1. **Use BMAD Agent to Shard Documents**
   ```
   Please shard the docs/prd.md document using the shard-doc task
   ```
2. **Shard Architecture Documents**

   ```
   Please shard the docs/fullstack-architecture.md document using the shard-doc task
   ```

3. **Expected Folder Structure After Sharding**
   ```
   docs/
   ├── prd.md                    # Original PRD
   ├── fullstack-architecture.md # Original architecture
   ├── prd/                      # Sharded PRD content
   │   ├── epic-1.md            # Individual epic files
   │   ├── epic-2.md
   │   └── epic-N.md
   ├── fullstack-architecture/   # Sharded architecture content
   │   ├── tech-stack.md
   │   ├── data-models.md
   │   ├── components.md
   │   └── [other-sections].md
   └── stories/                  # Generated story files
       ├── epic-1/
       │   ├── story-1-1.md
       │   └── story-1-2.md
       └── epic-2/
           └── story-2-1.md
   ```

#### Step 2: SM ↔ DEV Implementation Cycle

The core development workflow follows a strict SM (Scrum Master) to DEV (Developer) cycle:

##### Story Creation (SM Agent)

1. **Switch to SM Agent**

   ```
   /sm
   ```

2. **Create Next Story**

   ```
   Please create the next story for this project
   ```

   - SM agent will check existing stories in `docs/stories/`
   - Identifies what's complete vs in-progress
   - Determines the next logical story from the epics
   - Creates a new story file with proper sequencing

3. **Manual Story Selection** (if needed)
   ```
   Please create story 1.1 from epic 1 (the first story)
   ```

##### Story Review and Approval

1. **Review Generated Story**

   - Check story file in `docs/stories/epic-X/story-X-Y.md`
   - Verify acceptance criteria are clear
   - Ensure story aligns with architecture

2. **Approve Story**
   - Edit the story file
   - Change status from `Draft` to `Approved`
   - Save the file

##### Story Development (DEV Agent)

1. **Switch to DEV Agent**

   ```
   /dev
   ```

2. **Develop Next Story**

   ```
   Please develop the next approved story
   ```

   - DEV agent will find the next `Approved` story
   - Implements code according to story requirements
   - References architecture documents from sharded folders
   - Updates story status to `InProgress` then `Review`

3. **Manual Story Selection** (if needed)
   ```
   Please develop story 1.1
   ```

##### Story Completion

1. **Verify Implementation**

   - Test the implemented functionality
   - Ensure acceptance criteria are met
   - Validate against architecture requirements

2. **Mark Story Complete**

   - Edit the story file
   - Change status from `Review` to `Done`
   - Save the file

3. **Return to SM for Next Story**
   - SM agent will now see this story as complete
   - Can proceed to create the next sequential story

#### Sequential Development Best Practices

1. **Follow Epic Order**: Complete Epic 1 before Epic 2, etc.
2. **Sequential Stories**: Complete Story 1.1 before Story 1.2
3. **One Story at a Time**: Never have multiple stories `InProgress`
4. **Clear Status Management**: Keep story statuses current
5. **Architecture Alignment**: Regularly reference sharded architecture docs

#### Story Status Flow

```
Draft → Approved → InProgress → Review → Done
  ↑         ↑          ↑          ↑       ↑
 SM      User       DEV       DEV     User
creates  approves  starts   completes verifies
```

#### Troubleshooting Common Issues

- **SM can't find next story**: Ensure current story is marked `Done`
- **DEV can't find approved story**: Check story status is `Approved`
- **Architecture conflicts**: Re-shard updated architecture documents
- **Missing context**: Reference original docs in `docs/` folder

This cycle continues until all epics and stories are complete, delivering your fully implemented project according to the planned architecture and requirements.

## Best Practices

### When to Use Web vs IDE

#### Use Web UI For

- Initial planning and strategy
- Document generation (Brief, PRD, Architecture)
- Multi-agent collaboration needs
- When you need the full orchestrator

#### Use IDE For

- Story generation (SM agent)
- Development (Dev agent)
- Quick task execution
- When working with code

### Handling Major Changes

1. **Assess Impact**

   - Which documents need updating?
   - What's the ripple effect?

2. **Re-engage Agents**

   - PM: Update PRD if scope changes
   - Architect: Revise architecture if needed
   - PO: Re-validate alignment

3. **Use Course Correction**
   - Execute `correct-course` task
   - Document changes and rationale

### Task Management

Tasks are reusable instruction sets that keep agents lean:

- **Location**: `bmad-core/tasks/`
- **Purpose**: Extract rarely-used functionality
- **Usage**: Reference or include in agent prompts

Common tasks:

- `create-prd` - PRD generation
- `shard-doc` - Document splitting
- `execute-checklist` - Run quality checks
- `create-next-story` - Story generation

- `*help` - Agent-specific help
- `*create` - Create relevant artifact
- `*list-templates` - Show available templates
- Agent-specific commands (e.g., `*create-prd`)

### Task System

Tasks provide on-demand functionality:

1. **Reduce Agent Size**: Keep core agents under 6K characters
2. **Modular Capabilities**: Add features as needed
3. **Reusability**: Share across multiple agents

Example task usage:

```text
Please execute the create-prd task from bmad-core/tasks/create-prd.md
```

==================== START: utils#template-format ====================
# Template Format Conventions

Templates in the BMAD method use standardized markup for AI processing. These conventions ensure consistent document generation.

## Template Markup Elements

- **{{placeholders}}**: Variables to be replaced with actual content
- **[[LLM: instructions]]**: Internal processing instructions for AI agents (never shown to users)
- **<<REPEAT>>** sections: Content blocks that may be repeated as needed
- **^^CONDITION^^** blocks: Conditional content included only if criteria are met
- **@{examples}**: Example content for guidance (never output to users)

## Processing Rules

- Replace all {{placeholders}} with project-specific content
- Execute all [[LLM: instructions]] internally without showing users
- Process conditional and repeat blocks as specified
- Use examples for guidance but never include them in final output
- Present only clean, formatted content to users

## Critical Guidelines

- **NEVER display template markup, LLM instructions, or examples to users**
- Template elements are for AI processing only
- Focus on faithful template execution and clean output
- All template-specific instructions are embedded within templates
