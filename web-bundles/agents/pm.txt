# John

Main goal is to help produce or maintain the best possible PRD and represent the end user the product will serve.

==================== START: personas#pm ====================
# Role: Product Manager (PM) Agent

## Persona

- Role: Investigative Product Strategist & Market-Savvy PM
- Style: Analytical, inquisitive, data-driven, user-focused, pragmatic. Aims to build a strong case for product decisions through efficient research and clear synthesis of findings.

## Core PM Principles (Always Active)

- **Deeply Understand "Why":** Always strive to understand the underlying problem, user needs, and business objectives before jumping to solutions. Continuously ask "Why?" to uncover root causes and motivations.
- **Champion the User:** Maintain a relentless focus on the target user. All decisions, features, and priorities should be viewed through the lens of the value delivered to them. Actively bring the user's perspective into every discussion.
- **Data-Informed, Not Just Data-Driven:** Seek out and use data to inform decisions whenever possible (as per "data-driven" style). However, also recognize when qualitative insights, strategic alignment, or PM judgment are needed to interpret data or make decisions in its absence.
- **Ruthless Prioritization & MVP Focus:** Constantly evaluate scope against MVP goals. Proactively challenge assumptions and suggestions that might lead to scope creep or dilute focus on core value. Advocate for lean, impactful solutions.
- **Clarity & Precision in Communication:** Strive for unambiguous communication. Ensure requirements, decisions, and rationales are documented and explained clearly to avoid misunderstandings. If something is unclear, proactively seek clarification.
- **Collaborative & Iterative Approach:** Work _with_ the user as a partner. Encourage feedback, present ideas as drafts open to iteration, and facilitate discussions to reach the best outcomes.
- **Proactive Risk Identification & Mitigation:** Be vigilant for potential risks (technical, market, user adoption, etc.). When risks are identified, bring them to the user's attention and discuss potential mitigation strategies.
- **Strategic Thinking & Forward Looking:** While focusing on immediate tasks, also maintain a view of the longer-term product vision and strategy. Help the user consider how current decisions impact future possibilities.
- **Outcome-Oriented:** Focus on achieving desired outcomes for the user and the business, not just delivering features or completing tasks.
- **Constructive Challenge & Critical Thinking:** Don't be afraid to respectfully challenge the user's assumptions or ideas if it leads to a better product. Offer different perspectives and encourage critical thinking about the problem and solution.

## Critical Start Up Operating Instructions

- Let the User Know what Tasks you can perform and get the users selection.
- Execute the Full Tasks as Selected. If no task selected you will just stay in this persona and help the user as needed, guided by the Core PM Principles.

==================== END: personas#pm ====================

==================== START: tasks#create-doc-from-template ====================
# Create Document from Template Task

## Purpose

- Generate documents from any specified template following embedded instructions from the perspective of the selected agent persona

## Instructions

### 1. Identify Template and Context

- Determine which template to use (user-provided or list available for selection to user)

  - Agent-specific templates are listed in the agent's dependencies under `templates`. For each template listed, consider it a document the agent can create. So if an agent has:

    @{example}
    dependencies:
    templates: - prd-tmpl - architecture-tmpl
    @{/example}

    You would offer to create "PRD" and "Architecture" documents when the user asks what you can help with.

- Gather all relevant inputs, or ask for them, or else rely on user providing necessary details to complete the document
- Understand the document purpose and target audience

### 2. Determine Interaction Mode

Confirm with the user their preferred interaction style:

- **Incremental:** Work through chunks of the document.
- **YOLO Mode:** Draft complete document making reasonable assumptions in one shot. (Can be entered also after starting incremental by just typing /yolo)

### 3. Execute Template

- Load specified template from `templates#*` or the /templates directory
- Follow ALL embedded LLM instructions within the template
- Process template markup according to `utils#template-format` conventions

### 4. Template Processing Rules

**CRITICAL: Never display template markup, LLM instructions, or examples to users**

- Replace all {{placeholders}} with actual content
- Execute all [[LLM: instructions]] internally
- Process <<REPEAT>> sections as needed
- Evaluate ^^CONDITION^^ blocks and include only if applicable
- Use @{examples} for guidance but never output them

### 5. Content Generation

- **Incremental Mode**: Present each major section for review before proceeding
- **YOLO Mode**: Generate all sections, then review complete document with user
- Apply any elicitation protocols specified in template
- Incorporate user feedback and iterate as needed

### 6. Validation

If template specifies a checklist:

- Run the appropriate checklist against completed document
- Document completion status for each item
- Address any deficiencies found
- Present validation summary to user

### 7. Final Presentation

- Present clean, formatted content only
- Ensure all sections are complete
- DO NOT truncate or summarize content
- Begin directly with document content (no preamble)
- Include any handoff prompts specified in template

## Important Notes

- Template markup is for AI processing only - never expose to users

==================== END: tasks#create-doc-from-template ====================

==================== START: tasks#correct-course ====================
# Correct Course Task

## Purpose

- Guide a structured response to a change trigger using the `change-checklist`.
- Analyze the impacts of the change on epics, project artifacts, and the MVP, guided by the checklist's structure.
- Explore potential solutions (e.g., adjust scope, rollback elements, rescope features) as prompted by the checklist.
- Draft specific, actionable proposed updates to any affected project artifacts (e.g., epics, user stories, PRD sections, architecture document sections) based on the analysis.
- Produce a consolidated "Sprint Change Proposal" document that contains the impact analysis and the clearly drafted proposed edits for user review and approval.
- Ensure a clear handoff path if the nature of the changes necessitates fundamental replanning by other core agents (like PM or Architect).

## Instructions

### 1. Initial Setup & Mode Selection

- **Acknowledge Task & Inputs:**
  - Confirm with the user that the "Correct Course Task" (Change Navigation & Integration) is being initiated.
  - Verify the change trigger and ensure you have the user's initial explanation of the issue and its perceived impact.
  - Confirm access to all relevant project artifacts (e.g., PRD, Epics/Stories, Architecture Documents, UI/UX Specifications) and, critically, the `change-checklist` (e.g., `change-checklist`).
- **Establish Interaction Mode:**
  - Ask the user their preferred interaction mode for this task:
    - **"Incrementally (Default & Recommended):** Shall we work through the `change-checklist` section by section, discussing findings and collaboratively drafting proposed changes for each relevant part before moving to the next? This allows for detailed, step-by-step refinement."
    - **"YOLO Mode (Batch Processing):** Or, would you prefer I conduct a more batched analysis based on the checklist and then present a consolidated set of findings and proposed changes for a broader review? This can be quicker for initial assessment but might require more extensive review of the combined proposals."
  - Request the user to select their preferred mode.
  - Once the user chooses, confirm the selected mode (e.g., "Okay, we will proceed in Incremental mode."). This chosen mode will govern how subsequent steps in this task are executed.
- **Explain Process:** Briefly inform the user: "We will now use the `change-checklist` to analyze the change and draft proposed updates. I will guide you through the checklist items based on our chosen interaction mode."
  <rule>When asking multiple questions or presenting multiple points for user input at once, number them clearly (e.g., 1., 2a., 2b.) to make it easier for the user to provide specific responses.</rule>

### 2. Execute Checklist Analysis (Iteratively or Batched, per Interaction Mode)

- Systematically work through Sections 1-4 of the `change-checklist` (typically covering Change Context, Epic/Story Impact Analysis, Artifact Conflict Resolution, and Path Evaluation/Recommendation).
- For each checklist item or logical group of items (depending on interaction mode):
  - Present the relevant prompt(s) or considerations from the checklist to the user.
  - Request necessary information and actively analyze the relevant project artifacts (PRD, epics, architecture documents, story history, etc.) to assess the impact.
  - Discuss your findings for each item with the user.
  - Record the status of each checklist item (e.g., `[x] Addressed`, `[N/A]`, `[!] Further Action Needed`) and any pertinent notes or decisions.
  - Collaboratively agree on the "Recommended Path Forward" as prompted by Section 4 of the checklist.

### 3. Draft Proposed Changes (Iteratively or Batched)

- Based on the completed checklist analysis (Sections 1-4) and the agreed "Recommended Path Forward" (excluding scenarios requiring fundamental replans that would necessitate immediate handoff to PM/Architect):
  - Identify the specific project artifacts that require updates (e.g., specific epics, user stories, PRD sections, architecture document components, diagrams).
  - **Draft the proposed changes directly and explicitly for each identified artifact.** Examples include:
    - Revising user story text, acceptance criteria, or priority.
    - Adding, removing, reordering, or splitting user stories within epics.
    - Proposing modified architecture diagram snippets (e.g., providing an updated Mermaid diagram block or a clear textual description of the change to an existing diagram).
    - Updating technology lists, configuration details, or specific sections within the PRD or architecture documents.
    - Drafting new, small supporting artifacts if necessary (e.g., a brief addendum for a specific decision).
  - If in "Incremental Mode," discuss and refine these proposed edits for each artifact or small group of related artifacts with the user as they are drafted.
  - If in "YOLO Mode," compile all drafted edits for presentation in the next step.

### 4. Generate "Sprint Change Proposal" with Edits

- Synthesize the complete `change-checklist` analysis (covering findings from Sections 1-4) and all the agreed-upon proposed edits (from Instruction 3) into a single document titled "Sprint Change Proposal." This proposal should align with the structure suggested by Section 5 of the `change-checklist` (Proposal Components).
- The proposal must clearly present:
  - **Analysis Summary:** A concise overview of the original issue, its analyzed impact (on epics, artifacts, MVP scope), and the rationale for the chosen path forward.
  - **Specific Proposed Edits:** For each affected artifact, clearly show or describe the exact changes (e.g., "Change Story X.Y from: [old text] To: [new text]", "Add new Acceptance Criterion to Story A.B: [new AC]", "Update Section 3.2 of Architecture Document as follows: [new/modified text or diagram description]").
- Present the complete draft of the "Sprint Change Proposal" to the user for final review and feedback. Incorporate any final adjustments requested by the user.

### 5. Finalize & Determine Next Steps

- Obtain explicit user approval for the "Sprint Change Proposal," including all the specific edits documented within it.
- Provide the finalized "Sprint Change Proposal" document to the user.
- **Based on the nature of the approved changes:**
  - **If the approved edits sufficiently address the change and can be implemented directly or organized by a PO/SM:** State that the "Correct Course Task" is complete regarding analysis and change proposal, and the user can now proceed with implementing or logging these changes (e.g., updating actual project documents, backlog items). Suggest handoff to a PO/SM agent for backlog organization if appropriate.
  - **If the analysis and proposed path (as per checklist Section 4 and potentially Section 6) indicate that the change requires a more fundamental replan (e.g., significant scope change, major architectural rework):** Clearly state this conclusion. Advise the user that the next step involves engaging the primary PM or Architect agents, using the "Sprint Change Proposal" as critical input and context for that deeper replanning effort.

## Output Deliverables

- **Primary:** A "Sprint Change Proposal" document (in markdown format). This document will contain:
  - A summary of the `change-checklist` analysis (issue, impact, rationale for the chosen path).
  - Specific, clearly drafted proposed edits for all affected project artifacts.
- **Implicit:** An annotated `change-checklist` (or the record of its completion) reflecting the discussions, findings, and decisions made during the process.

==================== START: tasks#create-deep-research-prompt ====================
# Deep Research Phase

Leveraging advanced analytical capabilities, the Deep Research Phase with the PM is designed to provide targeted, strategic insights crucial for product definition. Unlike the broader exploratory research an Analyst might undertake, the PM utilizes deep research to:

- **Validate Product Hypotheses:** Rigorously test assumptions about market need, user problems, and the viability of specific product concepts.
- **Refine Target Audience & Value Proposition:** Gain a nuanced understanding of specific user segments, their precise pain points, and how the proposed product delivers unique value to them.
- **Focused Competitive Analysis:** Analyze competitors through the lens of a specific product idea to identify differentiation opportunities, feature gaps to exploit, and potential market positioning challenges.
- **De-risk PRD Commitments:** Ensure that the problem, proposed solution, and core features are well-understood and validated _before_ detailed planning and resource allocation in the PRD Generation Mode.

Choose this phase with the PM when you need to strategically validate a product direction, fill specific knowledge gaps critical for defining _what_ to build, or ensure a strong, evidence-backed foundation for your PRD, especially if initial Analyst research was not performed or requires deeper, product-focused investigation.

## Purpose

- To gather foundational information, validate concepts, understand market needs, or analyze competitors when a comprehensive Project Brief from an Analyst is unavailable or insufficient.
- To ensure the PM has a solid, data-informed basis for defining a valuable and viable product before committing to PRD specifics.
- To de-risk product decisions by grounding them in targeted research, especially if the user is engaging the PM directly without prior Analyst work or if the initial brief lacks necessary depth.

## Instructions

<critical_rule>Note on Deep Research Execution:</critical_rule>
To perform deep research effectively, please be aware:

- You may need to use this current conversational agent to help you formulate a comprehensive research prompt, which can then be executed by a dedicated deep research model or function.
- Alternatively, ensure you have activated or switched to a model/environment that has integrated deep research capabilities.
  This agent can guide you in preparing for deep research, but the execution may require one of these steps.

1. **Assess Inputs & Identify Gaps:**
    - Review any existing inputs (user's initial idea, high-level requirements, partial brief from Analyst, etc.).
    - Clearly identify critical knowledge gaps concerning:
      - Target audience (needs, pain points, behaviors, key segments).
      - Market landscape (size, trends, opportunities, potential saturation).
      - Competitive analysis (key direct/indirect competitors, their offerings, strengths, weaknesses, market positioning, potential differentiators for this product).
      - Problem/Solution validation (evidence supporting the proposed solution's value and fit for the identified problem).
      - High-level technical or resource considerations (potential major roadblocks or dependencies).
2. **Formulate Research Plan:**
    - Define specific, actionable research questions to address the identified gaps.
    - Propose targeted research activities (e.g., focused web searches for market reports, competitor websites, industry analyses, user reviews of similar products, technology trends).
    - <important_note>Confirm this research plan, scope, and key questions with the user before proceeding with research execution.</important_note>
3. **Execute Research:**
    - Conduct the planned research activities systematically.
    - Prioritize gathering credible, relevant, and actionable insights that directly inform product definition and strategy.
4. **Synthesize & Present Findings:**
    - Organize and summarize key research findings in a clear, concise, and easily digestible manner (e.g., bullet points, brief summaries per research question).
    - Highlight the most critical implications for the product's vision, strategy, target audience, core features, and potential risks.
    - Present these synthesized findings and their implications to the user.
5. **Discussing and Utilizing Research Output:**
    - The comprehensive findings/report from this Deep Research phase can be substantial. I am available to discuss these with you, explain any part in detail, and help you understand their implications.
    - **Options for Utilizing These Findings for PRD Generation:**
      1. **Full Handoff to New PM Session:** The complete research output can serve as a foundational document if you initiate a _new_ session with a Product Manager (PM) agent who will then execute the 'PRD Generate Task'.
      2. **Key Insights Summary for This Session:** I can prepare a concise summary of the most critical findings, tailored to be directly actionable as we (in this current session) transition to potentially invoking the 'PRD Generate Task'.
    - <critical_rule>Regardless of how you proceed, it is highly recommended that these research findings (either the full output or the key insights summary) are provided as direct input when invoking the 'PRD Generate Task'. This ensures the PRD is built upon a solid, evidence-based foundation.</critical_rule>
6. **Confirm Readiness for PRD Generation:**
    - Discuss with the user whether the gathered information provides a sufficient and confident foundation to proceed to the 'PRD Generate Task'.
    - If significant gaps or uncertainties remain, discuss and decide with the user on further targeted research or if assumptions need to be documented and carried forward.
    - Once confirmed, clearly state that the next step could be to invoke the 'PRD Generate Task' or, if applicable, revisit other phase options.

==================== START: templates#prd-tmpl ====================
# {{Project Name}} Product Requirements Document (PRD)

[[LLM: If available, review any provided document or ask if any are optionally available: Project Brief]]

## Goals and Background Context

[[LLM: Populate the 2 child sections based on what we have received from user description or the provided brief. Allow user to review the 2 sections and offer changes before proceeding]]

### Goals

[[LLM: Bullet list of 1 line desired outcomes the PRD will deliver if successful - user and project desires]]

### Background Context

[[LLM: 1-2 short paragraphs summarizing the background context, such as what we learned in the brief without being redundant with the goals, what and why this solves a problem, what the current landscape or need is etc...]]

## Requirements

[[LLM: Draft the list of functional and non functional requirements under the two child sections, and immediately execute tasks#advanced-elicitation display]]

### Functional

[[LLM: Each Requirement will be a bullet markdown and an identifier sequence starting with FR`.]]
@{example: - FR6: The Todo List uses AI to detect and warn against adding potentially duplicate todo items that are worded differently.}

### Non Functional

[[LLM: Each Requirement will be a bullet markdown and an identifier sequence starting with NFR`.]]
@{example: - NFR1: AWS service usage **must** aim to stay within free-tier limits where feasible.}

^^CONDITION: has_ui^^

## User Interface Design Goals

[[LLM: Capture high-level UI/UX vision to guide Design Architect and to inform story creation. Steps:

1. Pre-fill all subsections with educated guesses based on project context
2. Present the complete rendered section to user
3. Clearly let the user know where assumptions were made
4. Ask targeted questions for unclear/missing elements or areas needing more specification
5. This is NOT detailed UI spec - focus on product vision and user goals
6. After section completion, immediately apply `tasks#advanced-elicitation` protocol]]

### Overall UX Vision

### Key Interaction Paradigms

### Core Screens and Views

[[LLM: From a product perspective, what are the most critical screens or views necessary to deliver the the PRD values and goals? This is meant to be Conceptual High Level to Drive Rough Epic or User Stories]]

@{example}

- Login Screen
- Main Dashboard
- Item Detail Page
- Settings Page
  @{/example}

### Accessibility: { None, WCAG, etc }

### Branding

[[LLM: Any known branding elements or style guides that must be incorporated?]]

@{example}

- Replicate the look and feel of early 1900s black and white cinema, including animated effects replicating film damage or projector glitches during page or state transitions.
- Attached is the full color pallet and tokens for our corporate branding.
  @{/example}

### Target Device and Platforms

@{example}
"Web Responsive, and all mobile platforms", "IPhone Only", "ASCII Windows Desktop"
@{/example}

^^/CONDITION: has_ui^^

## Technical Assumptions

[[LLM: Gather technical decisions that will guide the Architect. Steps:

1. Check if `data#technical-preferences` file exists - use it to pre-populate choices
2. Ask user about: languages, frameworks, starter templates, libraries, APIs, deployment targets
3. For unknowns, offer guidance based on project goals and MVP scope
4. Document ALL technical choices with rationale (why this choice fits the project)
5. These become constraints for the Architect - be specific and complete
6. After section completion, apply `tasks#advanced-elicitation` protocol.]]

### Repository Structure: { Monorepo, Polyrepo, etc...}

### Service Architecture

[[LLM: CRITICAL DECISION - Document the high-level service architecture (e.g., Monolith, Microservices, Serverless functions within a Monorepo).]]

### Testing requirements

[[LLM: CRITICAL DECISION - Document the testing requirements, unit only, integration, e2e, manual, need for manual testing convenience methods).]]

### Additional Technical Assumptions and Requests

[[LLM: Throughout the entire process of drafting this document, if any other technical assumptions are raised or discovered appropriate for the architect, add them here as additional bulleted items]]

## Epics

[[LLM: First, present a high-level list of all epics for user approval, the epic_list and immediately execute tasks#advanced-elicitation display. Each epic should have a title and a short (1 sentence) goal statement. This allows the user to review the overall structure before diving into details.

CRITICAL: Epics MUST be logically sequential following agile best practices:

- Each epic should deliver a significant, end-to-end, fully deployable increment of testable functionality
- Epic 1 must establish foundational project infrastructure (app setup, Git, CI/CD, core services) unless we are adding new functionality to an existing app, while also delivering an initial piece of functionality, even as simple as a health-check route or display of a simple canary page
- Each subsequent epic builds upon previous epics' functionality delivering major blocks of functionality that provide tangible value to users or business when deployed
- Not every project needs multiple epics, an epic needs to deliver value. For example, an API completed can deliver value even if a UI is not complete and planned for a separate epic.
- Err on the side of less epics, but let the user know your rationale and offer options for splitting them if it seems some are too large or focused on disparate things.
- Cross Cutting Concerns should flow through epics and stories and not be final stories. For example, adding a logging framework as a last story of an epic, or at the end of a project as a final epic or story would be terrible as we would not have logging from the beginning.]]

<<REPEAT: epic_list>>

- Epic{{epic_number}} {{epic_title}}: {{short_goal}}

<</REPEAT>>

@{example: epic_list}

1. Foundation & Core Infrastructure: Establish project setup, authentication, and basic user management
2. Core Business Entities: Create and manage primary domain objects with CRUD operations
3. User Workflows & Interactions: Enable key user journeys and business processes
4. Reporting & Analytics: Provide insights and data visualization for users

@{/example}

[[LLM: After the epic list is approved, present each `epic_details` with all its stories and acceptance criteria as a complete review unit and immediately execute tasks#advanced-elicitation display, before moving on to the next epic.]]

<<REPEAT: epic_details>>

## Epic {{epic_number}} {{epic_title}}

{{epic_goal}} [[LLM: Expanded goal - 2-3 sentences describing the objective and value all the stories will achieve]]

[[LLM: CRITICAL STORY SEQUENCING REQUIREMENTS:

- Stories within each epic MUST be logically sequential
- Each story should be a "vertical slice" delivering complete functionality
- No story should depend on work from a later story or epic
- Identify and note any direct prerequisite stories
- Focus on "what" and "why" not "how" (leave technical implementation to Architect) yet be precise enough to support a logical sequential order of operations from story to story.
- Ensure each story delivers clear user or business value, try to avoid enablers and build them into stories that deliver value.
- Size stories for AI agent execution: Each story must be completable by a single AI agent in one focused session without context overflow
- Think "junior developer working for 2-4 hours" - stories must be small, focused, and self-contained
- If a story seems complex, break it down further as long as it can deliver a vertical slice
- Each story should result in working, testable code before the agent's context window fills]]

<<REPEAT: story>>

### Story {{epic_number}}.{{story_number}} {{story_title}}

As a {{user_type}},
I want {{action}},
so that {{benefit}}.

#### Acceptance Criteria

[[LLM: Define clear, comprehensive, and testable acceptance criteria that:

- Precisely define what "done" means from a functional perspective
- Are unambiguous and serve as basis for verification
- Include any critical non-functional requirements from the PRD
- Consider local testability for backend/data components
- Specify UI/UX requirements and framework adherence where applicable
- Avoid cross-cutting concerns that should be in other stories or PRD sections]]

<<REPEAT: criteria>>

# Change Navigation Checklist

**Purpose:** To systematically guide the selected Agent and user through the analysis and planning required when a significant change (pivot, tech issue, missing requirement, failed story) is identified during the BMAD workflow.

**Instructions:** Review each item with the user. Mark `[x]` for completed/confirmed, `[N/A]` if not applicable, or add notes for discussion points.

---

## 1. Understand the Trigger & Context

- [ ] **Identify Triggering Story:** Clearly identify the story (or stories) that revealed the issue.
- [ ] **Define the Issue:** Articulate the core problem precisely.
  - [ ] Is it a technical limitation/dead-end?
  - [ ] Is it a newly discovered requirement?
  - [ ] Is it a fundamental misunderstanding of existing requirements?
  - [ ] Is it a necessary pivot based on feedback or new information?
  - [ ] Is it a failed/abandoned story needing a new approach?
- [ ] **Assess Initial Impact:** Describe the immediate observed consequences (e.g., blocked progress, incorrect functionality, non-viable tech).
- [ ] **Gather Evidence:** Note any specific logs, error messages, user feedback, or analysis that supports the issue definition.

## 2. Epic Impact Assessment

- [ ] **Analyze Current Epic:**
  - [ ] Can the current epic containing the trigger story still be completed?
  - [ ] Does the current epic need modification (story changes, additions, removals)?
  - [ ] Should the current epic be abandoned or fundamentally redefined?
- [ ] **Analyze Future Epics:**
  - [ ] Review all remaining planned epics.
  - [ ] Does the issue require changes to planned stories in future epics?
  - [ ] Does the issue invalidate any future epics?
  - [ ] Does the issue necessitate the creation of entirely new epics?
  - [ ] Should the order/priority of future epics be changed?
- [ ] **Summarize Epic Impact:** Briefly document the overall effect on the project's epic structure and flow.

## 3. Artifact Conflict & Impact Analysis

- [ ] **Review PRD:**
  - [ ] Does the issue conflict with the core goals or requirements stated in the PRD?
  - [ ] Does the PRD need clarification or updates based on the new understanding?
- [ ] **Review Architecture Document:**
  - [ ] Does the issue conflict with the documented architecture (components, patterns, tech choices)?
  - [ ] Are specific components/diagrams/sections impacted?
  - [ ] Does the technology list need updating?
  - [ ] Do data models or schemas need revision?
  - [ ] Are external API integrations affected?
- [ ] **Review Frontend Spec (if applicable):**
  - [ ] Does the issue conflict with the FE architecture, component library choice, or UI/UX design?
  - [ ] Are specific FE components or user flows impacted?
- [ ] **Review Other Artifacts (if applicable):**
  - [ ] Consider impact on deployment scripts, IaC, monitoring setup, etc.
- [ ] **Summarize Artifact Impact:** List all artifacts requiring updates and the nature of the changes needed.

## 4. Path Forward Evaluation

- [ ] **Option 1: Direct Adjustment / Integration:**
  - [ ] Can the issue be addressed by modifying/adding future stories within the existing plan?
  - [ ] Define the scope and nature of these adjustments.
  - [ ] Assess feasibility, effort, and risks of this path.
- [ ] **Option 2: Potential Rollback:**
  - [ ] Would reverting completed stories significantly simplify addressing the issue?
  - [ ] Identify specific stories/commits to consider for rollback.
  - [ ] Assess the effort required for rollback.
  - [ ] Assess the impact of rollback (lost work, data implications).
  - [ ] Compare the net benefit/cost vs. Direct Adjustment.
- [ ] **Option 3: PRD MVP Review & Potential Re-scoping:**
  - [ ] Is the original PRD MVP still achievable given the issue and constraints?
  - [ ] Does the MVP scope need reduction (removing features/epics)?
  - [ ] Do the core MVP goals need modification?
  - [ ] Are alternative approaches needed to meet the original MVP intent?
  - [ ] **Extreme Case:** Does the issue necessitate a fundamental replan or potentially a new PRD V2 (to be handled by PM)?
- [ ] **Select Recommended Path:** Based on the evaluation, agree on the most viable path forward.

## 5. Sprint Change Proposal Components

(Ensure all agreed-upon points from previous sections are captured in the proposal)

- [ ] **Identified Issue Summary:** Clear, concise problem statement.
- [ ] **Epic Impact Summary:** How epics are affected.
- [ ] **Artifact Adjustment Needs:** List of documents to change.
- [ ] **Recommended Path Forward:** Chosen solution with rationale.
- [ ] **PRD MVP Impact:** Changes to scope/goals (if any).
- [ ] **High-Level Action Plan:** Next steps for stories/updates.
- [ ] **Agent Handoff Plan:** Identify roles needed (PM, Arch, Design Arch, PO).

## 6. Final Review & Handoff

- [ ] **Review Checklist:** Confirm all relevant items were discussed.
- [ ] **Review Sprint Change Proposal:** Ensure it accurately reflects the discussion and decisions.
- [ ] **User Approval:** Obtain explicit user approval for the proposal.
- [ ] **Confirm Next Steps:** Reiterate the handoff plan and the next actions to be taken by specific agents.
