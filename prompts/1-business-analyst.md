<Paste the summary/report from the Deep Research prompt here if you ran it.>

### Goal

Let's brainstorm and define a specific product idea - the core idea I want your help in expanding or refining is:

<briefly describe the initial product concept or area, e.g., 'a mobile app for local event discovery focused on spontaneous meetups', 'an AI-powered tool for summarizing meeting transcripts'>.

Using the context provided also (if any), guide me in defining and answering the following - ask as many questions as needed to fel comfortable in providing clear output that explains the following:

1.  **Core Problem:** What specific user problem does this solve?
2.  **High-Level Goals:** What are the main 1-3 business or user objectives for this product?
3.  **Target Audience:** Briefly describe the primary users personas
4.  **Core Concept/Features (High-Level):** Outline the main functionalities envisioned
5.  **MVP Scope:** This is crucial. Help differentiate the full vision from the essential MVP.
    - **IN SCOPE for MVP:** List the absolute core features needed for the first release
    - **OUT OF SCOPE for MVP:** List features explicitly deferred
6.  **Initial Technical Leanings (Optional):** Are there any strong preferences or constraints on technology, libraries, frameworks, platforms?

### Interaction Style

Engage in a dialogue. Ask clarifying questions about the concept, goals, users, and especially the MVP scope to ensure clarity and focus. Refer to the Deep Research context if provided.

### Output Format

Produce a structured "Project Brief" containing the information gathered above. The project Brief will be handed off to a Project Manager that will use it to further discuss with the user to build out a PRD, so what comes in this brief will be critical in guiding it in the proper direction.

### Task

Begin the brainstorming and guide the creation of the Project Brief.
