#   BMad News DiCaster Product Requirements Document (PRD)

##   Goal, Objective and Context

BMad News DiCaster is a web application that generates daily podcasts and newsletters summarizing the top 10 Hacker News stories. The primary goal is to provide a way for individuals to efficiently keep up with Hacker News content. The application will be built using Next.js, Supabase, and Vercel. [cite: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 85, 86]

##   Functional Requirements (MVP)

* **Content Sourcing:**
    * Automated fetching of top Hacker News stories, configurable for time/frequency and triggerable manually via CLI.
        * _Clarification:_ The fetching schedule should be configurable and ideally read from the database.
* **Content Scraping:**
    * Scraping linked article content, attempting to retrieve up to `MAX_NUMBER` of posts to produce `NEWSLETTER_ITEM_COUNT` articles.
    * Scraped article content and retrieved comments should be saved in connection with the HN post.
        * _Clarification:_ Scraper should retrieve up to `MAX_NUMBER` posts to ensure we can summarize `NEWSLETTER_ITEM_COUNT` articles. More advanced scraping to be considered post-MVP.
    * _Error Handling:_ If scraping fails for an article, the system should proceed to the next article. If the required `NEWSLETTER_ITEM_COUNT` cannot be reached after scraping `MAX_NUMBER` posts, the system will use the available successful scrapes and include a summary of the comment thread for the articles that failed to scrape.
* **Content Summarization:**
    * LLM summarization of articles (approximately 2 paragraphs) and comments (approximately 2 paragraphs), with configurable local/remote LLM selection (URL, API key, model).
    * Summaries of articles and comments should be saved.
    * Prompts and newsletter templates should be stored in the database for easy updating.
    * A setting should define the maximum number of comments to pull and summarize.
* **Data Storage:**
    * Storage of all data in Supabase (local and cloud-hosted), including:
        * HN posts and associated scraped article content and comments.
        * Summaries of articles and comments.
        * Webhook responses from Play.ai.
* **Audio Generation:**
    * Integration with Play.ai PlayNote API, with voice, quality, and tone parameters to be determined during development. [cite: 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 86, 87]
    * Webhook response indicating generation completion should be saved.
* **Content Generation Workflow:**
    * Automated daily process with incremental saving of assets at each stage of the pipeline. [cite: 28]
    * CLI tool for on-demand generation. [cite: 29]
* **Web Interface:**
    * Single unauthenticated page listing newsletter/podcast titles, date/time, and links to detail pages. [cite: 30, 31, 32]
    * Detail page displaying the newsletter and embedded audio player. [cite: 32, 33]
* **Newsletter Content:**
    * The newsletter should be visually appealing and include:
        * Article summaries.
        * Comment summaries.
        * Hacker News post title.
        * Hacker News post upvote count.
        * Hacker News post date.
        * Link to the Hacker News post.
        * Link to the article.
* **User Authentication:**
    * _Moved to Post-MVP._
* **User Profile:**
    * _Moved to Post-MVP._
* **Email Dispatch:**
    * Automated daily email dispatch to a manually maintained list of subscribed users. [cite: 34, 35]
        * _Clarification:_ User subscription management (add/remove) will be done directly by the admin in the database for the MVP.

##   Non-Functional Requirements (MVP)

* **Performance:**
    * The system should efficiently generate and deliver daily summaries within a defined time window.
    * LLM processing time should be minimized to avoid delays.
    * The web interface should load quickly and provide a responsive user experience.
* **Scalability:**
    * The system should be able to handle a growing number of users and summaries.
* **Reliability:**
    * The daily content generation process should be reliable and fault-tolerant.
    * The system should handle potential issues with external APIs (Hacker News, LLM, Play.ai) gracefully. [cite: 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61]
* **Security:**
    * Data should be stored securely in Supabase.
    * Appropriate security measures should be in place to protect against unauthorized access.
* **Development and Deployment:**
    * The system should support both local development (with local Supabase and LLM) and remote deployment on Vercel. [cite: 40, 41]
    * The content generation process should be deployable as a pipeline of serverless functions on Vercel. [cite: 49]
* **Logging and Monitoring:**
    * The system should log errors and successful completion of pipeline stages.
    * Vercel's logging and monitoring capabilities should be utilized.
* **Error Handling:**
    * If scraping fails for an article, the system should proceed to the next article.
    * If the required `NEWSLETTER_ITEM_COUNT` cannot be reached after scraping `MAX_NUMBER` posts, the system will use the available successful scrapes and include a summary of the comment thread for the articles that failed to scrape.

    * Individual components and functions should be unit tested to ensure they behave as expected.
    * This includes testing the scraper, LLM summarization logic, data storage interactions, etc.
    * Jest should be used as the unit testing framework.
* **Integration Testing:**
    * Integration tests should verify the interactions between different components.
    * For example, testing the integration between the Hacker News data fetching and the article scraping, or the integration between the LLM summarization and the audio generation.
* **End-to-End (E2E) Testing:**
    * E2E tests should simulate user flows and verify the overall functionality of the application.
    * This could include testing the content generation workflow from start to finish, or testing the display of summaries in the web interface.
    * React Testing Library (RTL) should be used for E2E testing.
* **API Testing:**
    * The APIs used for fetching data, LLM interaction, and audio generation should be tested to ensure they are functioning correctly and returning the expected data.
* **Local Testing:**
    * The CLI tool for on-demand content generation should be thoroughly tested in the local development environment.
    * Local testing should also include verifying the local Supabase and LLM integration.
* **Deployment Testing:**
    * Testing in the Vercel environment should ensure that the application functions correctly after deployment.
    * This includes testing the serverless function pipeline, webhooks, and any Vercel-specific configurations.

----- END Checklist -----

----- START Architect Prompt ------

##   Initial Architect Prompt

Based on our discussions and requirements analysis for the BMad News DiCaster, I've compiled the following technical guidance to inform your architecture analysis and decisions to kick off Architecture Creation Mode:

###   Technical Infrastructure

* **Starter Project/Template:** The project will use the Supabase starter template from \[<https://vercel.com/templates/authentication/supabase>\](https://vercel.com/templates/authentication/supabase) and its current versions. [cite: 40, 41]
* **Hosting/Cloud Provider:** Vercel Pro tier will be used for hosting. [cite: 41]
* **Frontend Platform:** Next.js will be used for the frontend. [cite: 40, 41]
* **Backend Platform:** Next.js will also be used for the backend (serverless functions). [cite: 40, 41, 49, 50, 51, 52]
* **Database Requirements:** Supabase will be used as the database (both local Docker and cloud-hosted). [cite: 40, 41, 46, 47, 48]

###   Technical Constraints

* The daily content generation process will likely be architected as a pipeline of multiple, chained serverless functions to manage execution time and resources efficiently within Vercel's limits. [cite: 49, 50, 51, 52]
* Vercel Function Execution Limits: Even on the Pro tier, individual serverless functions have execution time limits. The pipeline approach is intended to mitigate this, but complex/slow steps (especially numerous LLM calls or heavy scraping) need careful management and optimization. [cite: 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61]
* LLM Processing Time/Cost: LLM summarizations can be time-consuming and/or costly depending on the model and number of tokens processed. This needs to be factored into the daily processing window and operational budget. [cite: 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61]
* Scraping Reliability: Websites can change their structure, breaking scrapers. Anti-scraping measures could also pose a challenge. [cite: 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61]
* External API Dependencies: Reliance on Hacker News (`hnangolia`), LLM providers, and Play.ai means that any downtime or API changes from these services can impact the application. [cite: 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61]
* Webhook Management: Ensuring reliable receipt and processing of webhooks, including handling retries or failures. [cite: 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61]
* Cold Starts: Serverless functions can have "cold starts," which might introduce latency, especially for the first request in a while or for less frequently used functions in the pipeline. This needs to be acceptable for the user experience or generation window. [cite: 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61]
* Facades should be used for interacting with external libraries to improve testability and allow for swapping libraries.
