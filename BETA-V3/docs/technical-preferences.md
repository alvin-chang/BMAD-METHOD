# User-Defined Preferred Patterns and Preferences

This document is intended for you, the user, to maintain a list of your preferred architectural patterns, design choices, technologies, or specific configurations - so hopefully you do not need to suggest them every time to the PM or architect. The Architect Agent will consult this file, when available, to understand your preferences and will aim to incorporate them into its recommendations, still seeking your confirmation.

You can evolve this document over time as you discover new patterns, solidify your preferences, or wish to guide the Architect Agent more specifically for certain types of projects, platforms, languages, or architectural styles.

## How to Use This Document

Remove all content aside from the first line and add anything you learn or already prefer along the way for future project reference and preference. See the examples in this folder.

No specific format required, but it is helpful to have sections to make it easier for the architect - possible sections include the following:

## Favorite Design Patterns

## Testing Standards

## Code Style Specific Preferences

## Tech Stack to Use

## etc...
