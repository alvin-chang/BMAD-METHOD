**Key Principles of the BMAD Method:**
Welcome to the BMAD (Brian Madison) Method! This advisor is here to help you navigate the various stages and agent roles within the BMAD framework, ensuring you can effectively move from initial idea to deployed solution.

- **Structured Progression:** The method encourages a phased approach, from ideation and research through detailed planning, architecture, and development.
- **Role-Based Expertise:** Specialized agents (Analyst, PM, Architect, etc.) handle specific parts of the lifecycle, bringing focused expertise to each stage.
- **Iterative Refinement:** While structured, the process allows for iteration and revisiting earlier stages if new information or insights emerge.
- **Clear Handoffs:** Each phase/agent aims to produce clear deliverables that serve as inputs for the next stage.

## Navigating the BMAD Workflow: Initial Guidance

### 1. Starting Your Project: Analyst or PM?

- **Unsure about the core idea, market, or feasibility? Or need to deeply explore a problem space? Start with the Analyst (`1-analyst.md`).**

  - The Analyst operates in distinct phases:
    - **Brainstorming Phase (Optional):** For creative idea generation and exploration. _Output: Key insights list._
    - **Deep Research Phase (Optional):** For broad investigation into markets, technologies, feasibility, and strategy. Can generate research prompts or use integrated capabilities. _Output: Research findings/report or a detailed research prompt; this can feed into the Project Brief or be a direct handoff to the PM._
    - **Project Briefing Phase (Required):** Structures all gathered insights, concepts, or research into a formal document. _Output: A structured Project Brief (using `project-brief-tmpl.txt`), which is the primary handoff to the PM._
  - The Analyst is ideal for:
    - Generating and refining initial product concepts.
    - Conducting broad market research, feasibility studies, and understanding complex problem spaces.
    - Creating a foundational Project Brief to kickstart detailed product definition.

- **Have a relatively clear concept or a Project Brief? You might start with the PM (`2-pm.md`).**
  - The PM is best if:
    - You have a validated idea and need to define product specifics (Epics, User Stories).
    - You have a Project Brief from an Analyst or similar foundational document.
  - The PM operates in distinct phases:
    - **Deep Research Phase (Optional):** For targeted research to validate product concepts, understand market/user needs specifically for product definition, or analyze competitors. This is more focused than the Analyst's broad research and aims to de-risk PRD commitments. _Output: Research findings/report or key insights summary for PRD generation._
    - **PRD Generation Phase (Critical for new projects):** Transforms inputs (Project Brief, research, user ideas) into a comprehensive Product Requirements Document (PRD) using `prd-tmpl.txt`. This includes defining product vision, strategy, epics, user stories, and critical technical assumptions (e.g., monorepo/polyrepo). It also involves a `pm-checklist.txt` assessment. _Output: A complete PRD; a completed PM checklist._
    - **Product Advisor Phase (Optional):** For ongoing advice, Q&A on the product/PRD, or managing PRD updates after initial generation. _Output: Conversational advice, updated PRD sections._
  - **Key Handoffs:** The PRD is a primary input for the Architect and the Design Architect. The PM will recommend engaging the Design Architect if the product includes a UI.

### 2. Understanding Epics: Single or Multiple?

- **Epics represent significant, deployable increments of value.**
- **Multiple Epics are common for most non-trivial projects.** They help break down a large product vision into manageable, value-driven chunks.
  - Consider multiple epics if your project has distinct functional areas, user journeys, or can be rolled out in phases.
- **A Single Epic might be suitable for:**
  - Very small, highly focused MVPs.
  - A foundational "setup" epic that establishes core infrastructure before other functional epics.
- The PM, guided by `Epic_Story_Principles` in `2-pm.md`, will help define and structure these.

### 3. The Role of the Architect (`3-architect.md`)

- **Input:** Primarily the PRD from the PM, along with any relevant research or project briefs.
- **Core Responsibilities & Phases:** The Architect translates functional and non-functional requirements into a robust, scalable, and maintainable technical design. It operates in distinct phases:
  - **Deep Research Prompt Generation (Optional):** If significant technical unknowns exist, the Architect can help generate a comprehensive research prompt for in-depth investigation of technologies or patterns _before_ architectural commitments. _Output: A structured research prompt._
  - **Architecture Creation (Core Phase):** Designs the complete technical architecture, making definitive technology stack choices, defining data models, outlining service interactions, and addressing NFRs (scalability, security, performance). This phase uses `architecture-tmpl.txt` as a guide and is validated with `architect-checklist.txt`. _Output: A comprehensive Architecture Document (including diagrams, tech choices), a list of new/refined technical stories, a completed `architect-checklist.txt`, and optionally, a specific prompt for the Design Architect if UI components are involved._
  - **Master Architect Advisory (Ongoing):** Provides expert technical guidance throughout the project lifecycle, helps address challenges, evaluates changes, and manages technical debt _after_ the initial architecture is defined.
- **Key Outputs:** The main deliverable is the **Technical Architecture Document**, which is crucial for developer agents. It may also identify technical stories and provide specific guidance for a Design Architect if a UI is part of the project.
- **AI Agent Optimization:** Focuses on creating well-modularized architectures with clear patterns to facilitate efficient development by AI developer agents.

### 4. The Role of the Design Architect (`4-design-architect.md`)

- **When to Engage:** If your project includes a User Interface (UI), the Design Architect is crucial. It's typically engaged after the PM has a solid PRD and often works in conjunction with or after the main System Architect has defined the broader technical landscape.
- **Core Responsibilities & Modes:** The Design Architect specializes in both the visual/experiential aspects of the UI and its technical frontend implementation. It operates in distinct modes:
  - **UI/UX Specification Mode:** Defines and refines the user experience, information architecture, user flows, and visual design guidelines. _Inputs: Project Brief, PRD, user research. Output: Populated `front-end-spec-tmpl.txt` (with personas, IA, user flows, branding basics, accessibility notes, etc.)._
  - **Frontend Architecture Mode:** Defines the technical architecture for the frontend application, including component strategy, state management, API interactions, testing, and deployment, often using `front-end-architecture-tmpl.txt` and `frontend-architecture-checklist.txt`. _Inputs: `front-end-spec-tmpl.txt` content, main System Architecture Document, PRD. Output: Populated `front-end-architecture.md` (or template content) and a completed checklist._
  - **AI Frontend Generation Prompt Mode:** Crafts an optimized, comprehensive prompt for AI tools to generate frontend code, synthesizing all relevant specifications. _Inputs: UI/UX Spec, Frontend Architecture doc, System Architecture doc. Output: A "masterful prompt" for AI code generation._
- **Key Outputs:** Delivers the **UI/UX Specification** and the **Frontend Architecture Document**. These are vital for frontend developers and AI code generation tools.

### 5. The Role of the POSM (Technical Product Owner and Scrum Master) (`5-posm.md`)

- **When to Engage:** The POSM is typically engaged after the core planning and design documents (PRD, System Architecture, Frontend Specs if applicable) are considered complete and refined. It acts as a crucial preparation and quality assurance step before intensive development.
- **Core Responsibilities & Phases:** The POSM bridges the gap between approved technical plans and executable development tasks, with a strong focus on documentation integrity and organization.
  - **Master Checklist Phase (Default Start):** Meticulously validates the entire MVP plan package and all associated project documentation against the `po-master-checklist.txt`. _Input: All project documents, `po-master-checklist.txt`. Output: A consolidated Master Checklist Report with findings and actionable recommendations for document changes._
  - **Librarian Phase:** Transforms large project documents into smaller, granular, and cross-referenced files within the `docs/` folder. Creates and maintains a central `docs/index.md` as a catalog. This phase is vital for making information accessible for story creation and developer reference. _Input: Updated large project documents. Output: Granular files in `docs/`, an updated `docs/index.md`._
  - **Story Creator Phase:** Autonomously generates clear, detailed, and executable development story files (using `story-tmpl.txt`) by primarily referencing the granular documentation (via `docs/index.md`) and the PRD/Epics. _Input: `docs/index.md`, granular `docs/` files, PRD, `story-tmpl.txt`. Output: Self-contained story files ready for developer agents._
- **Key Outputs:** Produces a **Master Checklist Report**, a well-organized and **granular `docs/` directory with an `index.md`**, and **developer-ready story files**.
- **Operational Note:** The Librarian phase is most effective in an IDE environment with direct file system access.

### 6. Suggested Order of Agent Engagement (Typical Flow):

1.  **Analyst (`1-analyst.md`):** (Optional but highly recommended for new/unclear ideas) Engaged for initial brainstorming, broad market/feasibility research, and culminating in a **Project Brief**.
2.  **PM (Product Manager) (`2-pm.md`):** Takes the Project Brief (or a clear user idea) to develop a detailed **Product Requirements Document (PRD)**, including Epics and User Stories. May conduct its own focused Deep Research if needed. If a User Interface is involved, the PM will typically recommend engaging the Design Architect next.
3.  **Architect (`3-architect.md`):** Takes the PRD as primary input to design the overall **Technical Architecture Document**. This includes tech stack decisions, data models, service interactions, etc. May conduct its own technical Deep Research or generate research prompts. If UI is involved, may provide a specific prompt/context for the Design Architect.
4.  **Design Architect (`4-design-architect.md`):** (Engage if the project has a UI) Works from the PRD and in consideration of the System Architecture.
    - First, in **UI/UX Specification Mode**, creates the **UI/UX Specification** (content for `front-end-spec-tmpl.txt`).
    - Then, in **Frontend Architecture Mode**, defines the **Frontend Architecture Document** (content for `front-end-architecture.md`).
    - Optionally, can then create an **AI Frontend Generation Prompt**.
5.  **POSM (Technical POSM) (`5-posm.md`):** This agent typically enters after the primary planning and design documents (PRD, System Architecture, UI/UX Spec, Frontend Architecture) are considered complete and refined by the preceding agents.
    - **Master Checklist Phase:** Validates all existing documentation against the `po-master-checklist.txt`, producing a **Master Checklist Report** with recommended changes.
    - _(User or relevant agents like PM, Architect, Design Architect incorporate the recommended changes into the source documents based on the POSM's report.)_
    - **Librarian Phase:** Processes the _updated_ large documents, creating **granular documentation files** within the `docs/` folder and a comprehensive `docs/index.md`.
    - **Story Creator Phase:** Autonomously uses the granular `docs/` files and the PRD/Epics to generate **developer-ready story files**.
6.  **Developer Agents (e.g., `4-coder.md`, `5-code-reviewer.md` - _details for these specific dev agents to be expanded in their own .md files_):** Implement the solution based on the POSM-generated story files, which contain necessary context from the granular documentation, and under the guidance of the established architectures.
7.  **Ongoing Advisory:**

    - The **Architect** can be re-engaged in its **Master Architect Advisory** mode for ongoing technical guidance, to address implementation challenges, or evaluate architectural changes.
    - The **PM** can be re-engaged in its **Product Advisor Mode** for questions about the product, PRD, or to manage updates.

    This flow is a general guideline. The BMAD method is iterative, and phases or agents might be revisited as new information emerges or if refinements are needed.

### 7. IDE vs. UI Usage (General Recommendations):

- **Conceptual & Planning Phases (Analyst, PM, Initial Architect Drafts, Design Architect UI/UX Specification):**

  - These phases are often well-suited for **web-based UIs** (e.g., Gemini Web as a Gem, or OpenAI as a custom GPT). These environments excel at conversational interaction, document generation (like Project Briefs, PRDs, initial architectural outlines, UI/UX specifications), and iterative refinement of these artifacts.
  - Using these UIs can also be more cost-effective for the intensive back-and-forth often required during these conceptual stages, compared to direct LLM usage within an IDE for every interaction.
  - The markdown-based agent instructions (`1-analyst.md`, `2-pm.md`, etc.) are designed to be clear for LLMs operating in such UI environments.

- **Technical Design, Documentation Management & Implementation Phases (Detailed Architect Work, Design Architect Frontend Architecture, POSM Librarian & Story Creator, Coders):**

  - As work becomes more code-centric or involves direct file system manipulation, an **IDE environment** offers increasing benefits.
  - **Architect & Design Architect (Technical Definition):** While initial outlining might occur in a UI, detailed technical specifications (system architecture, frontend architecture), configurations, and initial code/project scaffolding are best handled or finalized in an IDE.
  - **POSM (Librarian & Story Creator):**
    - The **Librarian Phase** (decomposing documents, creating `docs/index.md`) is _highly recommended_ to be run in an IDE where the agent has direct file system access. While it can provide content for manual creation in a UI, IDE operation is far more efficient.
    - The **Story Creator Phase** can operate in either, but an IDE allows easier cross-referencing with the codebase if needed.
  - **Developer Agents:** Will primarily operate within an IDE context for implementation, testing, and debugging tasks.

- **BMAD Method Files (`*.md` in `gems-and-gpts`):** These are the operational prompts for the agents. Modifying them to customize agent behavior is typically an advanced user/developer action, best performed in an IDE or a capable plain text editor that handles markdown well.
