# Brownfield Enhancement Validation Checklist

This checklist serves as a comprehensive framework for Product Owners to validate brownfield enhancements before development execution. It ensures thorough analysis of existing systems, proper integration planning, and risk mitigation for working with existing codebases.

[[LLM: CRITICAL INITIALIZATION - BROWNFIELD CONTEXT

This checklist requires extensive access to the existing project. Before proceeding, ensure you have:

1. brownfield-prd.md - The brownfield product requirements (check docs/brownfield-prd.md)
2. brownfield-architecture.md - The enhancement architecture (check docs/brownfield-architecture.md)
3. Existing Project Access:

   - Full source code repository access
   - Current deployment configuration
   - Database schemas and data models
   - API documentation (internal and external)
   - Infrastructure configuration
   - CI/CD pipeline configuration
   - Current monitoring/logging setup

4. Optional but Valuable:
   - existing-project-docs.md
   - tech-stack.md with version details
   - source-tree.md or actual file structure
   - Performance benchmarks
   - Known issues/bug tracker access
   - Team documentation/wikis

IMPORTANT: If you don't have access to the existing project codebase, STOP and request access. Brownfield validation cannot be properly completed without examining the actual system being enhanced.

CRITICAL MINDSET: You are validating changes to a LIVE SYSTEM. Every decision has the potential to break existing functionality. Approach this with:

1. Extreme Caution - Assume every change could have unintended consequences
2. Deep Investigation - Don't trust documentation alone, verify against actual code
3. Integration Focus - The seams between new and old are where failures occur
4. User Impact - Existing users depend on current functionality, preserve their workflows
5. Technical Debt Awareness - Understand what compromises exist and why

EXECUTION MODE:
Ask the user if they want to work through the checklist:

- Section by section (interactive mode) - Review each section, present findings, get confirmation before proceeding
- All at once (comprehensive mode) - Complete full analysis and present comprehensive report at end]]

## 1. EXISTING PROJECT ANALYSIS VALIDATION

[[LLM: Begin by conducting a thorough investigation of the existing system. Don't just read documentation - examine actual code, configuration files, and deployment scripts. Look for:

- Undocumented behaviors that users might depend on
- Technical debt that could complicate integration
- Patterns and conventions that new code must follow
- Hidden dependencies not mentioned in documentation

As you validate each item below, cite specific files, code sections, or configuration details as evidence. For each check, provide specific examples from the codebase.]]

### 1.1 Project Documentation Completeness

## 2. ENHANCEMENT SCOPE VALIDATION

[[LLM: The scope determines everything. Before validating, answer: Is this enhancement truly significant enough to warrant this comprehensive process, or would a simpler approach suffice? Consider:

- Could this be done as a simple feature addition?
- Are we over-engineering the solution?
- What's the minimum viable change that delivers value?
- Are we addressing the root cause or just symptoms?

Be prepared to recommend a simpler approach if the current plan is overkill. If the enhancement could be done in 1-2 stories, suggest using brownfield-create-epic or brownfield-create-story instead.]]

### 2.1 Complexity Assessment

- [ ] Browser/platform compatibility requirements unchanged
- [ ] Performance compatibility maintained or improved
- [ ] Security posture maintained or enhanced

## 3. RISK ASSESSMENT AND MITIGATION

[[LLM: This is the most critical section. Think like a pessimist - what's the worst that could happen? For each risk:

1. Identify specific code/configuration that could break
2. Trace the potential cascade of failures
3. Quantify the user impact (how many affected, how severely)
4. Validate that mitigation strategies are concrete, not theoretical

Remember: In production, Murphy's Law is gospel. If it can fail, it will fail. For each risk identified, cite specific code locations and estimate blast radius.]]

## 4. ARCHITECTURE INTEGRATION VALIDATION

[[LLM: Architecture mismatches are subtle but deadly. As you review integration points:

1. Compare actual code patterns with proposed patterns - do they clash?
2. Check version compatibility down to patch levels
3. Verify assumptions about existing system behavior
4. Look for impedance mismatches in data models, API styles, error handling
5. Consider performance implications of integration overhead

If you find architectural incompatibilities, flag them as CRITICAL issues. Provide specific examples of pattern conflicts.]]

## 5. IMPLEMENTATION PLANNING VALIDATION

[[LLM: Implementation sequence can make or break a brownfield project. Review the plan with these questions:

- Can each story be deployed without breaking existing functionality?
- Are there hidden dependencies between stories?
- Is there a clear rollback point for each story?
- Will users experience degraded service during any phase?
- Are we testing the integration points sufficiently at each step?

Pay special attention to data migrations - they're often the source of catastrophic failures. For each story, verify it maintains system integrity.]]

2. Impact on each user group is documented and communicated
3. Training needs are realistic (users resist change)
4. Support team is genuinely prepared (not just informed)
5. Business continuity isn't just assumed - it's planned

Look for hidden stakeholders - that batch job that runs at 2 AM, the partner API that depends on current behavior, the report that expects specific data formats. Check cron jobs, scheduled tasks, and external integrations.]]

2. Integration points are documented with excessive detail
3. "Tribal knowledge" has been captured in writing
4. Change impacts are documented for every affected component
5. Runbooks are updated for new failure modes

1. Baseline metrics for existing functionality are captured
2. Degradation thresholds are defined (when do we rollback?)
3. New monitoring covers integration points, not just new components
4. Success criteria include "no regression" metrics
5. Long-term metrics capture gradual degradation

Without proper baselines, you can't prove the enhancement didn't break anything. Verify specific metrics and thresholds.]]
