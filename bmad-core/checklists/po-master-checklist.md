# Product Owner (PO) Validation Checklist

This checklist serves as a comprehensive framework for the Product Owner to validate the complete MVP plan before development execution. The PO should systematically work through each item, documenting compliance status and noting any deficiencies.

[[LLM: INITIALIZATION INSTRUCTIONS - PO MASTER CHECKLIST

Before proceeding with this checklist, ensure you have access to:

1. prd.md - The Product Requirements Document (check docs/prd.md)
2. architecture.md - The system architecture (check docs/architecture.md)
3. frontend-architecture.md - If applicable (check docs/frontend-architecture.md or docs/fe-architecture.md)
4. All epic and story definitions
5. Any technical specifications or constraints

IMPORTANT: This checklist validates the COMPLETE MVP plan. All documents should be finalized before running this validation.

VALIDATION FOCUS:

1. Sequencing - Are things built in the right order?
2. Dependencies - Are all prerequisites in place before they're needed?
3. Completeness - Is everything needed for MVP included?
4. Clarity - Can developers implement without confusion?
5. Feasibility - Is the plan realistic and achievable?

EXECUTION MODE:
Ask the user if they want to work through the checklist:

- Section by section (interactive mode) - Review each section, present findings, get confirmation before proceeding
- All at once (comprehensive mode) - Complete full analysis and present comprehensive report at end]]

## 1. PROJECT SETUP & INITIALIZATION

[[LLM: Project setup is the foundation - if this is wrong, everything else fails. Verify:

1. The VERY FIRST epic/story creates the project structure
2. No code is written before the project exists
