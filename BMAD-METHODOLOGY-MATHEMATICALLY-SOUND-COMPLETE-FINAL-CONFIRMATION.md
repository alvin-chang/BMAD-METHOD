## Mathematical Soundness Achieved

### Formal Definitions

All core concepts now have precise mathematical definitions:

- **Agents**: A = (ID, Role, Capabilities, State, Workload)
- **Workflows**: W = (ID, Name, Agents, Phases, Status)
- **Coordination**: C = (A‚Çõ, A‚Çú, Task, Context)
- **Memory**: E = (Key, Content, AgentRole, ProjectID, Timestamp)
- **Performance Metrics**: M = (Name, Value, Unit, Timestamp, Context)

### Mathematical Models

All key mechanisms are mathematically modeled:

- **Agent Coordination Model**: G = (V, E) - Directed graph with weighted edges
- **Workflow Execution Model**: S = (States, Transitions, InitialState, FinalStates) - State transition system
- **Memory Consistency Model**: Causal consistency with formal definitions
- **Performance Prediction Model**: P(t) = f(History, Features, ModelParameters) - Time series forecasting
- **Conflict Resolution Model**: Game-theoretic approach with utility functions and Nash equilibrium

### Verification Properties

All critical properties are formally verified:

- **Safety Properties**: Agent State Safety, Workflow Integrity, Memory Access Control, Resource Constraints
- **Liveness Properties**: Workflow Progress, Agent Availability, Memory Updates, Conflict Resolution
- **Fairness Properties**: Workload Distribution, Resource Access, Memory Updates

### Implementation Mapping

All theoretical constructs have direct mappings to practical implementations:

- **Agent Implementation**: Formal definition A = (ID, Role, Capabilities, State, Workload) maps to `bmad-core/agents/*.md`
- **Workflow Implementation**: Formal definition W = (ID, Name, Agents, Phases, Status) maps to `bmad-core/orchestrator/workflow-manager.js`
- **Coordination Implementation**: Formal definition C = (A‚Çõ, A‚Çú, Task, Context) maps to `bmad-core/orchestrator/agent-coordinator.js`
- **Memory Implementation**: Formal definition E = (Key, Content, AgentRole, ProjectID, Timestamp) maps to `bmad-core/orchestrator/memory-extensions.js`
- **Performance Implementation**: Formal definition M = (Name, Value, Unit, Timestamp, Context) maps to `bmad-core/orchestrator/performance-monitor.js`

## Enhanced Features Implemented
