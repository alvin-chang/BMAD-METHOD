## 4. Mathematical Models Application

### 4.1 Agent Coordination Model

The agent coordination model G = (V, E) is applied as follows:

**Vertices (Agents)**:

- V = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} representing Analyst, Architect, Developer, QA, DevOps

**Edges (Coordination Relationships)**:

- E = {(1,2), (2,3), (3,4), (4,5)} representing handoff relationships

**Edge Weights**:

- w(1,2) = 0.8 (High importance - requirements to design)
- w(2,3) = 0.9 (Very high importance - design to implementation)
- w(3,4) = 0.7 (Medium-high importance - implementation to testing)
- w(4,5) = 0.6 (Medium importance - testing to deployment)

The coordination optimization problem:
minimize Σ(e∈E) w(e) × d(e)
subject to:

- All required coordination relationships are satisfied
- Agent workload constraints are respected
- Resource constraints are met

### 4.2 Workflow Execution Model

The workflow execution model S = (States, Transitions, InitialState, FinalStates) is applied as follows:

**States**:

- States = {s₀, s₁, s₂, s₃, s₄, s₅} representing:
  - s₀: Initial state (requirements pending)
  - s₁: Requirements completed, design pending
  - s₂: Design completed, implementation pending
  - s₃: Implementation completed, testing pending
  - s₄: Testing completed, deployment pending
  - s₅: Deployment completed (final state)

**Transitions**:

- Transitions = {
  (s₀, "complete-req", s₁),
  (s₁, "complete-design", s₂),
  (s₂, "complete-impl", s₃),
  (s₃, "complete-test", s₄),
  (s₄, "complete-deploy", s₅)
  }

**InitialState**:

- InitialState = s₀

**FinalStates**:

- FinalStates = {s₅}

### 4.3 Memory Consistency Model

The memory consistency model follows causal consistency with the following implementation:

**Causal Relationships**:

- REQ-TMS-001 → ARCH-TMS-001 (Requirements causally precede Architecture)
- ARCH-TMS-001 → CODE-TMS-001 (Architecture causally precedes Code)
- CODE-TMS-001 → TEST-TMS-001 (Code causally precedes Testing)
- TEST-TMS-001 → DEPLOY-TMS-001 (Testing causally precedes Deployment)

**Consistency Guarantees**:

- All agents see causally related memories in the correct order
- Concurrent memories may be seen in different orders by different agents
- All memories are eventually consistent across all agents

### 4.4 Performance Prediction Model

The performance prediction model P(t) = f(History, Features, ModelParameters) is applied as follows:

**History**:

- Historical phase durations: [240, 180, 480, 240, 120] minutes
- Historical completion rates: [1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0]
- Historical resource utilization: [0.7, 0.8, 0.9, 0.7, 0.6]

**Features**:

- Current phase: Implementation (P₃)
- Current agent workload: Developer = 1 task
- Current resource utilization: 0.9
- Active bottlenecks: None detected

**ModelParameters**:

- Weight vector: [0.3, 0.4, 0.2, 0.1] for history, current phase, workload, resources
- Bias term: 10 minutes buffer time
- Confidence threshold: 0.8

**Prediction**:

- Predicted remaining time = (0.3 × avg_duration) + (0.4 × current_phase_time) + (0.2 × workload_factor) + (0.1 × resource_factor) + bias
- Predicted completion = current_time + predicted_remaining_time
- Confidence = 0.85 (based on historical completion rates and current progress)

### 4.5 Conflict Resolution Model

The conflict resolution model uses a game-theoretic approach with utility functions:

**Conflict Scenario**: Developer and QA disagree on testing approach

**Agents**:

- Developer: Prefers automated testing for speed
- QA: Prefers manual testing for thoroughness

**Utility Functions**:

- U_developer(strategy) = α × speed + β × quality - γ × effort
- U_qa(strategy) = δ × thoroughness + ε × quality - ζ × time

**Strategies**:

- Strategy 1: Pure automated testing
- Strategy 2: Pure manual testing
- Strategy 3: Hybrid approach (both automated and manual)

**Nash Equilibrium**:

- The hybrid approach (Strategy 3) provides the best balance
- Both agents achieve positive utility
- No agent can unilaterally improve their utility by changing strategy

## 5. Formal Verification Properties Application

### 5.1 Safety Properties

**Agent State Safety**:
∀A ∈ Agents: State(A) ∈ ValidStates

- All agents transition through valid states: available → busy → coordinating → available
- No agent enters invalid states like "error" or "crashed"
- State transitions are properly validated

**Workflow Integrity**:
∀W ∈ Workflows: Phases(W) are executed in order

- Requirements phase (P₁) completed before Design phase (P₂)
- Design phase (P₂) completed before Implementation phase (P₃)
- Implementation phase (P₃) completed before Testing phase (P₄)
- Testing phase (P₄) completed before Deployment phase (P₅)

**Memory Access Control**:
∀E ∈ MemoryEntries, ∀A ∈ Agents: AccessAllowed(E, A)

- Analyst can access requirements documents
- Architect can access architecture documents
- Developer can access implementation code
- QA can access test results
- DevOps can access deployment packages

**Resource Constraints**:
∀A ∈ Agents: Workload(A) ≤ MaxWorkload(A)

- Analyst workload: 1 ≤ 5 (within limits)
- Architect workload: 1 ≤ 5 (within limits)
- Developer workload: 1 ≤ 5 (within limits)
- QA workload: 1 ≤ 5 (within limits)
- DevOps workload: 1 ≤ 5 (within limits)

### 5.2 Liveness Properties

**Workflow Progress**:
∃t: Status(W, t) = completed

- The Task Management System workflow will eventually reach completion
- All phases will be executed in order
- The final state (s₅) will be reached

**Agent Availability**:
∃t: State(A, t) = available

- All agents will eventually return to available state
- After completing tasks, agents transition back to available
- No agents remain permanently busy or coordinating

**Memory Updates**:
E is eventually consistent

- All memory entries become consistent across agents
- Updates propagate to all relevant agents
- No stale memory entries persist indefinitely

**Conflict Resolution**:
∃t: Resolved(C, t)

- Conflicts between agents are eventually resolved
- The hybrid testing approach is adopted
- Both Developer and QA agree on the resolution

### 5.3 Fairness Properties

**Workload Distribution**:
|Workload(Aᵢ) - Workload(Aⱼ)| ≤ Threshold

- All agents have similar workload: 1 task each
- Difference between any two agents: 0 ≤ 1 (threshold)
- Workload is evenly distributed

**Resource Access**:
A gets fair access to R

- All agents get fair access to computational resources
- No agent is starved of resources
- Resource allocation is balanced

**Memory Updates**:
All memory updates are eventually visible to all relevant agents

- Requirements document visible to Architect after Analyst completes it
- Architecture document visible to Developer after Architect completes it
- Implementation code visible to QA after Developer completes it
- Test results visible to DevOps after QA completes them
